<big>THE MARY FRANCES COOK BOOK</big><br />

——OR——<br />

ADVENTURES AMONG THE KITCHEN PEOPLE</div>

<p>The Mary Frances Cook Book is the exceptionally clever and fascinating story of a little girl
who wanted to learn to help her mother. Only it is much more than a story. It tells in story
form how Mary Frances learned to cook. She wants to know what all the kitchen pots and pans
are for, so she asks them. And they tell her—the pots and pans talk. The book gives recipes in
the simplest, plainest words. It describes every operation clearly—just what Mary Frances did,
and how she learned to avoid mistakes. The book stimulates the imagination and creates a desire
to follow Mary Frances’ example. 8vo. Cloth, 170 pages. Over 200 colored illustrations by
Margaret G. Hayes and Jane Allen Boyer.</p>

<big>THE MARY FRANCES SEWING BOOK</big><br />

——OR——<br />

ADVENTURES AMONG THE THIMBLE PEOPLE</div>

<p>It tells, in as quaint and delightful a story as ever appealed to a child’s imagination, how the
fairy Thimble People teach Mary Frances to sew. It teaches the reader how to sew—how to
make every variety of garment—how to make the various stitches—how to use patterns—how to
fold and cut the material—how to piece it together. The book includes a complete set of patterns
for doll-clothes—undergarments—street clothes—coats—hats—even a wedding dress.
Illustrated with 300 colored drawings that for interest and instruction are absolutely inimitable.
320 pages. 8vo. Cloth bound, with colored inlay on front. Colored illustrations by Jane Allen
Boyer on every page.</p>

ADVENTURES AMONG THE DOLL PEOPLE</div>

<p>A glimpse into this book is enough to make a girl’s heart leap. Here she finds not only the
story of the Paper Doll Family of Sandpile Village, and how they acquired a home, but also the
paper dolls themselves—thirty-six large sheets of dolls and of the new, patented kind of cut-out
furniture. The practical explanations of household duties and management are woven in so
skilfully that as the story tells how Mary Frances learned to dust, or sweep, or make beds, the
little reader takes it all in eagerly as part of the story. 250 pages. 7¼ x 9½ inches. Illustrations
on every page. Cloth, with colored inlay on front.</p>

<p>Mary Frances and Billy have been growing up,
and with their growing, they have learned to love
the great out-of-doors.</p>

<p>No, they haven’t outgrown fairy folk, at least
Mary Frances hasn’t, for that is a part of this story—how
Feather Flop, the rooster, and Jack-in-the-Pulpit
and Bouncing Bet, the fairies of the wood, helped
teach her to garden.</p>

<p>But in their study and work, Mary Frances and
Billy learned more than that—they learned to appreciate
what a wonderful amount of energy is expended
by Mother Nature in growing one little plant
from a seed; how careful she is that nothing be
wasted; and what pleasure there is in tilling the soil,
and helping things grow!</p>

<p>Everything else in the Mary Frances stories had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
to do with indoors: in cooking, feeding the body;
in sewing, clothing the body; in housekeeping, sheltering
the body. In gardening, which took them
out-of-doors, the children had so much fun and had
so much to learn, that the whole story cannot be
put down here—you must finish it out for yourselves
in your own gardens.</p>

<p>That you, too, may learn to help things grow,
and share the pleasure which Mary Frances and
Billy, and their friends, Eleanor and Bob, had in
making a garden, is the wish of</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“OH, dear, I can’t understand a word this book
says,” sighed Mary Frances, who was sitting
on the garden bench, looking over a seed
catalogue. “I can’t understand it!”</p>
<div>
<img class="splitr" src="images/i-019a.jpg" alt="page deco" width="105" height="499" />
<img class="splitr" src="images/i-019b.jpg" alt="page deco" width="492" height="208" />
</div>

<p>“Of course you can’t,” said a strange voice. “Not
without help.”</p>

<p>Mary Frances was startled; she looked about, but
saw no one.</p>

<p>“Why, who can it be?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You can’t without help, I said.”</p>

<p>Feather Flop, the big Rhode Island Red rooster,
came strutting around the corner of the bench.</p>

<p>“Why, is it you?” cried Mary Frances. “What do
you know about gardening?”</p>

<p>“I ought to know a lot about gardening. I’ve
lived in a garden most of the time ever since I was
hatched,” shrilled Feather Flop.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have,” laughed Mary Frances, “and
you’ve eaten up what you oughtn’t to, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was when I was bad. I’m going to be good
now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that is different,” replied Mary Frances.
“What’s the first thing to do?”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Feather Flop, scratching
his head with one foot. “Let me see—why, the
first thing—the first thing is to get the ground
ready!”</p>

<p>“What do you do to get it ready?” asked Mary
Frances.</p>

<p>“Why, dig, of course,” answered Feather Flop. “I
can dig.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” replied Mary Frances, “I see you
really want to help me, so we’ll plan out what we’re
going to do. I want all kinds of flowers and vegetables.”</p>

<p>“Did you start the seeds in the house in March so
that some would be ready to set out now?” asked
Feather Flop anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Mary Frances, “but Billy did. He
has a lot of little seedlings growing.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you steal some?” asked Feather Flop.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Feather Flop,” said Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Frances. “Would you? I’d rather ask Billy for
them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything about me when you do,”
begged the rooster.</p>

<p>“Why?” queried Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of him. He’s chased me out of
the——”</p>

<p>“Vegetable garden several times this Spring,
already,” laughed Mary Frances. “Maybe if he knew
how much you wanted to help with this surprise garden
of mine, he would be kinder to you.”</p>

<p>“He’s kind enough,” said Feather Flop, “but I’m
not anxious to know him much better yet a while. So
I’ll ask you not to mention me.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Mary Frances, “I think I understand.
But Billy wouldn’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>“Do you really wish me to help you, Miss Mary
Frances?” asked the rooster.</p>

<p>“I certainly do, Feather Flop,” said the little girl;
“if you will be so kind.”</p>

<p>She could scarcely keep from laughing at how pleased
and proud he looked.</p>

<p>“Then, let us take a look at the garden plot,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
said, leading the way to the front of Mary Frances’
play house.</p>

<p>“I’ll set right to work,” said Feather Flop, beginning
to scratch, “right to work, and dig the whole afternoon,
and early to-morrow morning, too.”</p>

<p>“Don’t work too hard,” said the little girl. “I
think I ought to help you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, little Miss,” answered Feather Flop.
“Why, see what’s done already.”</p>

<p>Mary Frances put her hand over her mouth to
keep from laughing aloud as she looked at the little
round hole the rooster had made.</p>

<p>“You do splendidly,” she said, “and to-morrow
morning I’ll be here bright and early.”</p>

<p>“Just one question,” called Feather Flop. “Is
the garden a secret?”</p>

<p>Mary Frances turned back. “In a way,” she
explained. “You see, Father gave Billy a part of our
big garden for his camp and garden——”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Feather Flop, nodding. “I was
down there one day—and I don’t care to go again.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask Father for a garden plot of my
own,” went on Mary Frances, “but Billy said, ‘Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
don’t you have a flower garden in front of your play
house, and a vegetable garden back of it and surprise all
the folks?’ You can’t imagine, Feather Flop, how
delighted I was with that idea.”</p>

<p>“Fine idea!” agreed Feather Flop, scratching again.
“Won’t it be splendid when the things grow!”</p>

<p>“And won’t it be a perfectly lovely surprise!” cried
Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“I won’t tell anybody,” volunteered Feather Flop.
“It will be grand to have a real secret with someone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, good old Feather Flop,” answered
Mary Frances. “Are you certain you don’t want me to
help spade up the garden?”</p>

<p>“Claws were made before spades,” said Feather
Flop, scratching away. “I’d like to do this myself,
please. Come bright and early in the morning when
you hear me crow.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">VERY early in the morning Mary Frances awoke
and listened a long time for Feather Flop’s
signal, but not a sound was to be heard except
the faint crowing of a distant rooster at the far end of
the village.</p>

<p>“I expect he crowed before I was awake,” concluded
Mary Frances, as she quickly dressed and went
down-stairs on tiptoe.</p>

<p>The sun was just getting up as she ran out into the
garden.</p>

<p>“Hello, Feather Flop,” she called softly as she
hurried along, but there was not a sight or sound of
Mr. Rooster.</p>

<p>“Mercy,” she thought, “I hope nothing’s happened
to him. Where can he be? Oh, see, he’s dug—let me
count,” (counting them off) “eighteen holes! My, it
must have tired him out.”</p>

<p>“But where can he be?” she went on, and called
again and again as loudly as she dared:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Feather Flop!”</p>

<p>“<i>Feather Flop!</i>”</p>

<p>“FEATHER FLOP!”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe he’s in my play house!” she suddenly
thought and ran to look. And there he was—where do
you think? Fast asleep in one of the doll’s beds with
the covers tucked close up under his bill!</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a funny kind of a gardener,” laughed
Mary Frances as soon as she recovered from her astonishment.
“Here it is long past crowing time.”</p>

<p>Feather Flop turned over. Then he began to
mutter sleepily:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I don’t care what people say,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I shan’t get up and crow to-day;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I’ve never laid in bed—so then!</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I shall not crow till half-past ten—to-night!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, Feather Flop!” cried Mary Frances. “Oh,
Feather Flop! How you disappoint me! Why, I’ve
gotten up early because you promised to help in my
garden! Come, get up!” going toward the bed.</p>

<p>“Excuse me!” exclaimed Feather Flop, hopping
out of bed. “Excuse my bad manners, dear Miss,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and away he ran out the door and into the garden
before Mary Frances could catch up.</p>

<p>“My, but you can dress quickly, Feather Flop,”
she called.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing like having your clothes grow on you,”
answered Feather Flop, lifting his wings, “especially if
they are pretty.”</p>

<p>Mary Frances laughed. “Come, come, no conceited
remarks, please,” she chided; “and now to work.”</p>

<p>“It takes longer than you’d think,” said Feather
Flop, beginning to scratch, “especially with an empty
stomach.”</p>

<p>“How dreadful of me not to think of your breakfast,
Feather Flop,” she said, and ran to get some corn.</p>

<p>“Thanks, thanks,” said Feather Flop, hungrily eating.
“If they only didn’t keep the food locked up, I
could help myself, and not have to trouble anybody.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is not gardening,” he went on; “and
besides, I want my dessert. I had splendid luck yesterday—four
hundred and fifty-one grubs I ate, and
several score of nice long worms. Besides, I let Robin
Redbreast have a hundred or so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my,” shuddered Mary Frances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Feather Flop, looking
up. “You didn’t want any, did you? I’d have been
delighted to have saved some for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my, no!” cried Mary Frances. “Oh, no,
thank you! No!”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?” inquired Feather Flop. “Well, you
must certainly be glad they are not left here in the
garden to eat up your plants, I know.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I’m much obliged, Feather Flop,” said
Mary Frances. “While you dig, I’m going into the
house to get some seeds, and to plan out my garden.”</p>

<p>“All right!” said Feather Flop. “Don’t mention
me, please, to——you know.”</p>

into the house, “I say, let’s start work in
your garden to-day. The first thing to do
is to dig and spade it.”</p>

</div>
<p>“Oh, Billy, it looks as though it had been done,”
answered Mary Frances. “I guess I can plant it right
away.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Billy. “Why, it has to be dug
deep; the earth has to be turned under, and compost
mixed with it and all pulverized before little seeds or
plants can take hold with their roots.”</p>

<p>“How deep?” asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Oh, about a foot, I guess,” said Billy; “but don’t
let’s talk too loud if you want to keep this garden a
secret. Let’s go out and have a look at it.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t mind—” began Mary Frances, but
Billy was well on the way.</p>

<p>“That old Rhode Island Red! See what he’s
done!” exclaimed Billy, throwing a stone at the rooster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Billy,” begged Mary Frances. “Poor old
Feather Flop! Don’t scare him! Maybe he thought
he was helping!”</p>

<p>“Helping?” laughed Billy. “Helping! If he tries
to help that way when things come up, I’ll wring his
neck!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you wouldn’t do that, Billy,” cried Mary
Frances. “He’ll be good, I know.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Billy, “you’re responsible for his
behavior then—he’s your rooster. I’d like to clip
his wings and cut his tail off right up next his ears—maybe.”</p>

<p>“He will be good, Billy, I feel sure,” answered Mary
Frances. “But you are very kind to dig my garden
up.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Billy with a very grown-up air,
“I know what sort of an undertaking this is. How’re
you going to lay the garden out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know yet,” answered Mary Frances.
“Won’t you help me plan it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s best to begin with pencil and paper;
that’s the first thing Miss Gardener told us in our
‘Home Garden Course.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, here they are,” laughed Mary Frances,
throwing open the play house door.</p>

<p>“Fine,” said Billy, seating himself at Mary
Frances’ little desk and helping himself to the articles
needed.</p>

<p>“But wait,” he continued. “If I show you how
to plan this surprise garden you must carry out my
directions. I don’t get caught with any promise to
do all the work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! No—indeedy! Of course not; I’m just
crazy to start and I promise not to trouble you a
bit.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” said Billy, “here goes for the—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Garden Lesson No. 1</span><br />

<i>Planning a Garden</i></h3>

<p>First: How much ground have you to work in?</p>

<p>Let us say 15 x 25 ft. in front of the play house for
the Flower Garden, and 15 x 15 ft. in the rear for the
Vegetable Garden.”</p>

<p>He rapidly drew an outline of the two gardens
with a pretty sketch of the play house between.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now,” he went on, “you will wish to leave a
walk down the center with a border of flowers on each
side,” sketching them in.</p>

<p>“You see, the beauty of a garden depends so much
on the way it is laid out that garden planning has
become a profession, and the man who studies it is
known as a landscape gardener.”</p>

<p>“My,” laughed Mary Frances, “how much you
learned at the garden school; you’re lots better than a
seed catalogue.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” replied Billy, “that’ll do for
bouquets. Now listen: the way to grow early Spring
flowers is to plant bulbs in the Autumn—about the
first of November. Then, early in March, sometimes
even in February, tiny snowdrops will pop up and, a
little later, beautiful crocuses.”</p>

<p>“Won’t that be grand!” cried Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Yes, in the next lesson perhaps, I’ll give you a list
of bulbs and plants which you can set out at the proper
time.</p>

<p>“The best scheme for the vegetable garden is to work
it out into small rectangular beds between well-kept
walks,” said Billy, finishing the—</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lay-out of the Gardens</span></h3>

<p>“How perfect!” exclaimed Mary Frances examining
the sheet of paper which Billy handed her. “I
can just imagine how beautiful my gardens will look.
Isn’t it a lovely idea to have that circle in the walk!”</p>

<p>“It would look fine if it had a sun-dial built in the
center,” said Billy, much pleased with his sister’s
praise.</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy, Billy,” laughed Mary Frances, “I
believe, I do believe you are going to surprise me!”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” cried Billy. “I
must be going—another lesson to-morrow, if you say
so, because you didn’t interrupt more than twice while
I was talking.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NEITHER of the children had noticed the head
of the big rooster as he peered curiously
through the curtained window of the play
house while they were talking.</p>

</div>
<p>As Mary Frances came out of the door, Feather
Flop walked around the corner of the house. The
little girl was so absorbed in looking at the plan that
she did not see the rooster.</p>

<p>“Caw-caw!” Feather Flop cleared his throat.
“Caw-caw!”</p>

<p>“Why, Feather Flop,” cried Mary Frances, “How
you surprised me! I was so busy studying out Billy’s
plan for the garden——”</p>

<p>“Is he anywhere about?” inquired Feather Flop,
looking around anxiously. “I thought I saw him
go.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s gone, Feather Flop,” laughed Mary
Frances. “But let me show you—he has been planning
such a delightful garden for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Delightful!” shrilled Feather Flop. “Delightful!
I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Why, what makes you say that? How do you
know what he planned?” inquired Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“I heard every word, every word,” said the rooster.
“Of course you didn’t see me—I was peeping in the
window.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Feather Flop!” cried Mary Frances. “Were
you eaves-dropping?”</p>

<p>“I was listening,” acknowledged Feather Flop,
“and I don’t approve of the plan at all.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s wrong with it?” asked Mary
Frances. “I think it’s beautiful.”</p>

<p>“It’s not sensible!” said Feather Flop. “It’s not
useful!”</p>

<p>“But it seems perfect to me. How would you
change it, Feather Flop?”</p>

<p>“Nobody can eat flowers!” exclaimed Feather Flop.
“See here,” he looked over Mary Frances’ shoulder
as she sat down on the bench, and pointed with his
claw, “that plan fills the entire front yard with bloomin’
plants and gives only the little back yard for such
things as taste good!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dearie me! Dearie me!” laughed Mary Frances.
“Is that it, Feather Flop? Why, don’t you love to see
beautiful flowers?”</p>

<p>“Not half as much as I do to eat beautiful lettuce
and beet tops and other beautiful vegetables,” declared
Feather Flop, shaking his head sadly.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, Feather Flop,” said Mary Frances,
smoothing his fine feathers, “but I’ll see that you get
plenty of such green things as you like.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, little Miss,” said the rooster.
“If you will do that, I’m ready to help with your silly—I
mean your brother’s, plan.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Feather Flop, for all your help,”
said the little girl, “and good-bye for now. I must go
or maybe mother will send Billy to look for me.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye! good-bye!” cried Feather Flop, jumping
off the bench and running away as fast as possible.</p>

said Mary Frances, getting the desk ready.</p>

<p>“This time we are to make a list of what to plant,

<p>“Let me see: we will try to plant the garden so
that we will have flowers in bloom from early Spring
till late Fall.</p>

<p>In order to have flowering plants continuously in
the garden, we must use the class of flowers called

<span class="smcap">What to Plant</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now, Mary Frances, I have really planned a delightful
landscape flower garden for you to plant in front of your play
house, and a wonderfully useful vegetable garden for the back
of the play house; but before I give you that outline, I am going
to pretend that you are a very little girl, and I will give you a
list, just as our teacher handed it to us. I have it here:</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Garden for Little Folks</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Plan out the garden; that is, make a list of what you
wish to plant.</p>

<p>2. Draw a picture map of your garden, marking the space
where each different kind of flower or vegetable is to be planted.</p>

<p>3. Remember that low-growing plants should be placed in
the foreground (front part) of the garden, and tall-growing plants
in the background.</p>

<p>4. Order the plants or seeds.</p>

<p>5. Get the ground ready. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>.)</p>

<p>6. Now begin to plant, following instructions in <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">Chapter XV</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The plants whose roots live on from season to season, or
“winter over,” and come up every Spring, are called Hardy
Perennials.</p>

<p>The plants whose roots die in the Fall, and do not “winter
over,” are called Annuals.</p>

<p>When a boy or a girl undertakes to start a flower garden,
how much more desirable it seems to plant, for the most part,
Hardy Perennials, which will “come up” the next Summer and
the next, and so on for years; instead of Annuals, the seeds
of which must be sowed every Spring.</p>

<p>Of course, the seeds of Hardy Perennials may be sowed in
the Spring, but <i>Hardy Perennial plants raised from seeds, seldom
bloom until the next year after the seeds are planted</i>.</p>

Therefore, it is best for the beginner, in most cases, to

<p class="unindent"><i>Dear Boy or Girl:</i></p>

<p><i>No doubt you will wish, just as Mary Frances did, to be able to
cut flowers every few days from your garden, for your mother to use
as a “center piece” on the dining table, or for your father’s desk,
or for your grandmother’s dresser, or as a gift for a friend.</i></p>

<p><i>Now, anyone can have a few plants which will bloom at some
time or other, but the garden you and Mary Frances have in mind
is one which will have flowers in bloom from March, through April,
May, June, July, August, September, October, and into November
until ruined by frost.</i></p>

<p><i>Flowers over eight months of the year! Yes, that is possible in
nearly every part of our country—if you study carefully the outlines
following this page.</i></p>

<p><i>The first outline gives a list of plants which bloom in the Early
Spring.</i></p>

<p><i>The second names the plants which bloom in Early Summer.</i></p>

<p><i>The third, the plants which bloom in Mid-Summer.</i></p>

<p><i>The fourth, those blooming in Autumn.</i></p>

<p><i>These lists are nearly like the ones given Billy by his teacher,
which he and Mary Frances used in planting a garden in front
of the Play House. As you read these lists, turn to the pictures
of the Mary Frances Garden Cut-Outs, and try to recognize the
flower named.</i></p>

<p><i>All that Mary Frances wished, she and Billy made “come
true,” and every day through the flowering season she gathered flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
from, her garden—but that is part of the story, so now begin to
read</i></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Few Hints on Growing the Flowers Shown in the
Garden Cut-Outs</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In using the following lists, if the garden space is small,
select only the names marked with a star.</p>

<p>The height of each plant is given because it is always desirable
to plant low-growing flowers in the foreground; and tall
ones in the background.</p>

<p>The following-named Perennials (the roots of which live
from year to year) may be grown from seeds, but <i>cannot be
depended upon to bloom the first year</i>.</p>

<p>Instead of beginners starting <i>seeds</i> of <i>Perennials</i>, it is well
to buy the young <i>plants</i> from a reliable dealer to start the permanent
garden, and to experiment with seeds after acquaintance
with those plants already established.</p>

<p>Do not buy many plants of any kind, as a few, well cared
for, will increase in number the next year.</p>

<p>Annuals (the roots of which die in the Fall) will bloom the
same season as planted. Start seeds early, either in a box in a
sunny window, or in a warm sunny corner out of doors early
in May.</p>

<p>The first step in garden-making is the planning of the garden.</p>

<p>(See <a href="#CHAPTER_LXII">Chapter LXII</a> on “The Mary Frances Garden Cut-Outs.”)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The second step is selection of the seed, and the ordering of
the same from one of the <i>best</i> seed firms.</p>

<p>Never try inferior or untested seeds. It is no economy.</p>

<p>In regard to “color scheme,” see <a href="#CHAPTER_LX">Chapter LX</a>.</p>

<p>For artistic effect, it is usually best to plant the same kind
of flowers close together to obtain “masses” of bloom.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />

<small><span class="smcap">Some Favorite Annuals</span></small></h2>

<p>A few Annuals may well be added to these lists. Even though
Annuals must be planted every Spring, there are many worth
the trouble; in fact, a garden would look lonesome without some
of the old favorites.</p>

<p>A very convenient arrangement is to give one bed in the
vegetable garden to the starting of Annuals.</p>

<p>The plants may be moved, when some size, to the hardy
garden, near the place of some of the Perennials which die down;
for instance, hyacinths, tulips, and other bulbs. Indeed, those
having short roots may be placed directly over the bulbs after
their leaves have withered and dried.</p>

<p>A border of low-growing Annuals along the vegetable beds
makes the vegetable garden a place of beauty.</p>

<p>If you live where there is snow in Winter, in order to have
early Summer blooms, the seeds must be started early, under
glass protection, in a sunny window, or in a hotbed. A box
with a glass cover is a good substitute for a hotbed. If the
seeds of Annuals are planted out of doors, they rarely bloom
before Mid-Summer, while many Perennials, which have been
out all Winter, bloom in early Spring. Select from the following
lists the flowers which from the description are most pleasing
to you.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Suggestions for Planting of Window Boxes</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Have the boxes made with small holes, or outlets, so that
there may be good drainage; for although plants love to drink
water, they do not enjoy having “soaking wet feet” all the time.</p>

<p>2. In the bottom of the box place some pebbles or broken
stone; this, also, to make the drainage good.</p>

<p>3. Fill box with sifted sand and humus (or manure) very
much as for seed boxes. See <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>.</p>

after knowing what to plant, we must learn how to
plant. So let us go have a look at the soil near the
play house.”</p>

<p>In front of the play house, Billy caught up a handful
of earth.</p>

<p>“Listen, Mary Frances,” he said, earnestly, “let
us examine this closely. To test the soil is the most
important point in gardening, as you will readily see
after you have heard—</p>


<h3>GARDEN LESSON No. 3</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Testing the Soil</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are very few places where the soil is “just right” for
plants.</p>

<p>In order to find out what kind of soil is in your garden, you
may make a little test by squeezing some tight in your hand.</p>

<p>Almost any soil, if very damp, will “hold together;” that is,
if a handful is squeezed, it will stay in the shape of the hand, so
do not make the test until two or three days after a rain, when it
will be quite dry.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Clayey Soil</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If, in a couple of days after a rain, the soil is sticky, something
like putty, and a squeezed handful holds together, and shows the
marks of your fingers, it is clayey soil.</p>

<p>Now, if the soil in your garden is clayey, it will never, never
do for plant babies. No indeed!</p>

<p>You see, it holds so close together that the little roots cannot
push it apart, and cannot grow. So to clayey soil you must add
something which will lighten it up; like sand, or even coal ashes,
or stable manure which contains a large quantity of straw.</p>

<p>Deep digging and forking help a lot, too, in breaking up the
tight hold which clay grains have upon each other. Sometimes
that in itself will make the clay sufficiently light.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Sandy Soil</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Little plant babies are so delicate that a very sandy bed
would not do for them either, for a rain might wash away the soil
from their roots.</p>

<p>All plants are very particular, and grow best if their bed is
“just right.”</p>

<p>So, if in a couple of days after a rain, a squeezed handful of
your garden soil will not hold together at all, and sifts through
your fingers, heavier material must be added.</p>

<p>A little clay worked into the sand and run over with a
roller helps; but there is something even better—it is stable
manure.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Humus</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Stable manure<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> not only helps hold sandy soil together and
lightens clayey soils, but it contains a very great deal of plant
food in the form of humus, and without humus all the other plant
food in the soil is of very little value to the plant.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">What Humus Is</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I know you are going to ask me what humus is; but first I
want to ask you to think what the soil is. Yes, dirt, that is right;
but dirt came from where?</p>

<p>For the most part from broken and crumbled-up rock, for
this earth was once nearly all of rock.</p>

<p>But dirt or soil is not only rotten and broken and crumbled-up
rock, as you will see in one minute.</p>

<p>Do you remember how the leaves fell off the tree last Autumn,
and how the grass died down? What became of the leaves and grass?</p>

<p>They died, yes, and turned into leaf mold, which is one form
of humus.</p>

<p>You have guessed right, Mary Frances. Humus is decayed
vegetable matter.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">What Humus Does</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Humus mixed with water makes humus soup, which is the
very best kind of plant food, and the plant babies love it. They
drink it through their roots, you know.</p>

<p>Not only does humus help with the matter of food, but it
holds moisture in the soil, and in some almost magic way makes
other plant food into a form which the plant can use.</p>

<p>Of course, you wish to give your plants the best kind of
food, and of course you will want humus.</p>

<p>But suppose you cannot readily get stable manure, or leaf
mold from the woods, why then, you can make humus. Every day
the very things you need to make humus may be going to waste.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">To Make a Compost Heap</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Save all the vegetable tops, leaves, grass, etc. Pile them
up and let them decay. When decayed, they are humus.</p>

<p>Another way to make a compost heap is to dig grass sods
about eight inches square, and make them into a pile about two
feet high, with layers of earth and manure between, and let stand
in the weather to decay. Turn over when decayed. When
wanted for use, cut some down, knock apart and spread.</p>

<p>You have heard of sowing rye or oats, and “ploughing the
crop under” to enrich the soil; this makes humus out of the green
rye or oats and their roots.</p>

<p>The plant baby and big plants, too, need many different
kinds of food, but the most important is humus.</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">“OH, yes,” continued Billy “I’m going to tell
you how the plants eat, and why they are
so fond of plant-food soup, and why they
like bones (of course, for soup! that is right); but I
think you would prefer that story later on, and
would rather talk now about—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Garden Tools</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The best small garden tools are a “Ladies’ Set,” for they
are strong and yet small and pleasant to handle.</p>

<p>A fork for digging; a rake and a hoe and a “cultivator” are
necessary.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">To Dig up the Garden</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Drive the fork down into the ground, with your left
foot on top of the prongs, and lift the clod of earth high enough
to turn over.</p>

<p>2. After dropping it, “spank” it apart into little lumps and
dust.</p>

<p>Commence this work at the back of the garden, and step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
backward over the untouched earth, until you have covered the
entire plot. Begin at the left-hand
corner “A” and across to the right.</p>

<p>In this way, you will not step
on the loosened soil, nor pack it
down.</p>

<p>Of course, in large fields, this work
is done with a plow.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Spading the Garden</span></div>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">To Prepare the Soil</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Spread humus or manure, or
both, all over the surface and dig it
in, in the same manner in which you
first dug up the garden, if you wish to
be entirely certain of having success.</p>

<p>But even then, the soil is not fine
enough. No. I see you shake your
head. But, Mary Frances, if you
want a lovely garden, you must get
the garden table ready for the plant
roots in the most enticing way.</p>

<p>2. Next, take your rake and
“comb” the earth to and fro until it is all light and
feathery.</p>

<p>Of course, in large fields, this work of raking is done with
a harrow.</p>

<p>3. After planting the seeds, pat the soil down firmly so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
it will be firm enough for the little rootlets to “get a hold,” yet
will be movable so that they may grow.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Little seeds are not always started, or planted, out of

<p>Instead, early in the Spring, seeds are often started in boxes
in a sunny window, or in hotbeds. (See Chapter LVII.)</p>

<p>We’ll make a hotbed of our own one of these days, Mary
Frances, but at present we’ll have to be satisfied with seed boxes.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. For starting seeds indoors, use shallow boxes, placed in
a sunny window.</p>

<p>Cigar boxes are of a convenient size for children to use.
The soil should be fine and rich in humus.</p>

<p>2. Sift some soil from the compost heap, or some leaf loam
(soil from the woods), or some well rotted stable manure,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
through a large mesh sieve (ash sifter) and mix with the same
amount of fine sand.</p>

<p>3. Fill the boxes with this mixture; water it well with a
fine sprinkler.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sowing the Seed Boxes</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Sow the seeds thinly, sprinkle them like pepper from a
shaker on the surface, and over them spread a very, very little
sand.</p>

<p>2. If possible, cover the box with glass to prevent the soil
from drying, but let the <i>air into the box by tilting the glass</i> on one
side, using a cork on the edge.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Watering the Seed Boxes</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Do not water often, but when necessary to do so, use
the finest sprinkler possible.</p>

<p>2. Water seed boxes in the morning. For if watered at night,
the tiny plants may “damp off,” or mildew.</p></div>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed Mary Frances, “how careful a
gardener has to be! What lovely beds must be made
for little seeds!”</p>

<p>“Exactly so,” agreed Billy. “I see you get the
point of the lesson. It is really about how to make
the beds for the seed babies.”</p>

<p>“The dear little things,” said Mary Frances.
“Billy, I had no idea how easily I would learn to
love the thought of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, then you’ll enjoy the next lesson,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Billy, turning over the leaves of his note book. “Our
professor told us next a good deal about the seed
babies.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we go right on now with that lesson?”
asked Mary Frances, in delight at the willingness
of Billy to teach her.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” replied Billy, looking at his watch.
“The ball team doesn’t meet until two-thirty.”</p>

</div>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Outdoors Seed-Bed</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Having found how to get the outdoors seed-bed ready, we
will next learn how to plant the seed.</p>

<p>Of course, you have made your list of the seeds needed, and
have received them from the dealer.</p>

<p>If possible, it is best to run the planting of the rows or drills
north and south so that <i>the sun will shine</i> upon the rows of
plants all day, from the east in the mornings; from the west in
the afternoons.</p>

<p>You will need a garden line to make a straight first row.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">To Make a Garden Line</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Cut two sticks about as large around as a broom handle,
each eighteen inches long.</p>

<p>2. Point the ends so that they may be easily stuck into the
ground.</p>

<p>3. Tie one end of a strong twenty-five foot cord to each
stick. Roll the cord on the stick.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">To Use the Garden Line</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Decide where you wish the first row of plants to grow.</p>

<p>2. Push the stick, not having the roll of cord, down into
the ground at the end of this imaginary row.</p>

<p>3. With the other stick in hand walk back, unrolling the
cord until you reach the other end of the imaginary row of little
plants. Try to make this row very straight, as all the other
rows will be measured from it.</p>

<p>By the way, this row should be quite near the edge of the
bed, so that you will not have to step on the loose “feathery” soil.</p>

<p>4. Drive the other stick down into the earth, drawing the
cord tight.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Planting in Drills</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Prepare the rake to mark the little rows, or drills, for
the seed. Have ready three good-sized corks. Stick the middle
tooth of the rake half way through one cork.</p>

<p>2. Do the same to the two end teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<div>
<img class="split" src="images/i-094a.jpg" alt="page deco" width="115" height="350" />
<img class="split" src="images/i-094b.jpg" alt="page deco" width="508" height="154" />
</div>
<p>3. Run one end tooth of the rake along the stretched garden
line keeping all the teeth parallel with the line. Continue to
use the rake across the entire bed. This is a convenient method
of getting straight rows. Make the drills (hollows) about a half
inch deep.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Broadcasting</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Seed are often not sowed in “drills,” but are “broadcast;”
where plants are to be thinned out when they come up, and not
to be transplanted, the <i>drills</i> are better.</p>

<p><i>Broadcasting</i> is throwing the seeds lightly over the surface
of the ground, so that each will fall a little way apart from the
other, like sprinkling with pepper from a pepper shaker.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Covering the Seeds</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After the seeds are sown, draw the earth lightly over them
either with your hands or with the back of the rake. It is best
to sow seeds just before a rain, except when the seeds are very
small; then, just after a rain. If there is no rain, sprinkle lightly,
but thoroughly dampen the earth.</p>

<p>Pat the earth down gently with the palms of your hands
or with a board.</p>

<p>A board is much the better if seed has been broadcast.</p>

<p>The reason? Oh, yes, the reason is that the soil will be too
light and airy unless firmed.</p>

<p>The little seed rootlets need close-packed light earth, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
no lumps. Just imagine how tiny they are, and how near to
them must be the tiny grains of sand for them to take hold on.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">To Mark the Beds</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After the seeds are planted, drive down at the ends of the
first and last rows little stakes, marked with the names of the
kind of seed planted in the section.</p></div>

<p>“Perhaps you think you will remember what kinds
of seed you’ve planted; but one is never certain.
Once I thought I had planted carrots and when the
plants grew, I had beets. It is not safe to try to
remember.</p>

<p>“So much, then, for how to put seed babies into
their beds.</p>

<p>“By and by, they are going to wake up, and we
must understand how to take care of them. The best
way to learn how to take care of them is to find out
what they are, and what they need.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />

<small><span class="smcap">Seed Babies and Their Nurses</span></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“FIRST of all, we must understand that the seed
has a coat which holds the living, sleeping baby.
You see, the baby itself is so tiny and delicate
that it would not be safe for it to be out without its
seed coat. The wind and the sun would soon dry it
up and kill it; then, too, it would die of hunger, for
it is too little to find its own food. So its mother
wraps the baby up in its strong seed coat, and puts
its food in beside it, in the same coat. And there
the seed baby lies sound asleep until—until everything
is just right for it to wake up. The time it likes
best to awaken is in Spring, when the weather is
getting warm.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Seed Babies in Their Coats</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You will put your seed babies, coats and all, into the warm
ground early in the Spring, when they will feel like growing. Then
you will dampen them, for without moisture and food, the seed
baby will not wake up. The moisture swells the seed coat, and
wakens the baby, and gets the food ready for the baby to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The baby begins to eat the food its mother put inside the
seed coat; it stretches itself, and pretty soon sends down into
the earth a “teeny-weeny” rootlet. This rootlet takes a little
food from the earth up to the baby. Oh, yes, plant soup, that
is the kind of food it takes. Plant soup is mixed earth and
water.</p>

<p>How good it is for the plant child, depends on how sweet
the soil is, and how much humus or compost or manure food is
in the soup. Humus soup tastes wonderfully good to the baby
plant.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cotyledons</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Well, not only does the baby plant send down this tiny
rootlet, but its tiny stem grows upward, and bursts through
the seed coats and show two tiny leaves.</p>

<p>The two tiny leaves which appear on top of this stem, while
down in the soil grew larger, threw open the seed coat, and came
up to the surface for the air and sunshine.</p>

<p>These leaves are called the seed-leaves, or cŏt-ŷ-lē´-dŏns.
They are not the true leaves of the plant baby, but are nurse-leaves
which go ahead of the leaves of the baby plant, and really
hold the true leaf of the baby between them.</p>

<p>These nurse-leaves take care of and feed the tiny plant
baby until it can send out its own tiny leaves to gather air and
digest food for itself.</p>

<p>If you pull up a Lima Bean Seed Baby after it has started
to grow you will see the nurse-leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>No plant should be moved or transplanted until at least
two true leaves, or leaves of its own, not nurse-leaves (cotyledons),
have appeared.</p>

<p>Of course, when the little plants first come up there will
be so many that each will choke the other, and so we must learn
about—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Thinning Out the Plants</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the little plants are about two inches high, pull up
all the weak plants, leaving the stronger ones from one to six
inches apart, according to the kind of plants.</p>

<p>The little plants will need moisture, too—not just “watering,”
but the moisture which lies far beneath the surface, and
which can only be had by keeping the surface soil in good condition,
so as when the plants grow one of the most important
things we have to learn to do is—</p></div>

<div>

<img class="splitr" src="images/i-103b.jpg" alt="page deco" width="521" height="205" />
</div>
<h3><span class="smcap">To Cultivate</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cultivating” means breaking up the soil where it hardens
about the plant. <i>It is the most important part of gardening</i> after
planting, except “thinning out.”</p>

<p>Cultivating is done by use of the hoe and “cultivator,” the
rake-like tool which has but few prongs. Draw the cultivator
between the rows of plants every day or two. Use the hoe in
smaller spaces. Use the hoe to chop down weeds below the
surface of the ground, being careful not to cut into the roots of
the garden plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>In breaking up the hard soil, or “cultivating,” the weeds
are destroyed, but hard soil is a worse enemy of plant babies
than weeds even, although every child knows how dreadful it
is for a garden to let weeds steal all the food from the baby
plants.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="plant needs">
<tr><td align="left">Baby plants need—</td><td align="left" class="btlb">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">air,<br />food,<br />
moisture.<br /></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Now if there is a hard crust of soil around the roots, they
cannot get the <i>air;</i> so we <i>cultivate</i> or break up the hard soil to
give them air.</p>

<p>Baby plants cannot get <i>food</i> if big strong weeds steal it
from them; so we <i>cultivate</i> to kill the weeds.</p>

<p>Baby plants need <i>moisture</i>, perhaps more than anything
else, so we cultivate; for cultivating keeps in the moisture that
is down in the soil. I will explain this in a very little while.</p>

<p>So you see <i>Cultivating</i> is the most important garden work.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Watering</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Perhaps you think watering the garden most important.
If so, you are mistaken. Yes, the garden must be watered from
time to time; but when it is watered it should be drenched soaking
wet, never sprinkled a little every day or two. One soaking
in a week is better than a light sprinkling every day. Light
sprinkling brings the roots to the surface, where the sun dries
them up in a short time. On the other hand, the rain or a thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
drenching soaks down, down, down, into the earth, where
it is stored up for future use.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Importance of Cultivating</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now, I am going to tell you why cultivating is so important
in regard to moisture.</p>

<p>If the soil is all soft and fine and loose, the rain can easily
run down through it to the roots.</p>

<p>If it were hard, the water would run off to lower ground.
That’s easily understood.</p>

<p>But immediately after the rain, when the sun comes out
and the wind blows, the surface of the soil begins to dry.</p>

<p>Then the sun “coaxes” and “pulls” the water up, up, up,
to the surface it has dried, something like the way you pull the
juice of an orange up through a stick of lemon candy. Now
let me ask you—could you pull much orange juice through the
stick of candy if the stick of candy were crumbled or broken
apart at the top? No, you could not.</p>

<p>Neither can the sun pull the moisture up through the tiny
little tubes in the soil if we break those little tubes and crumble
the tops into dust. No, you need not look for these tubes, Mary
Frances; they are too tiny for you to see, but they act
very much like blotting paper to bring the under moisture
up to the surface, and unless they are broken and crumbled, the
deep earth moisture goes sailing off into the air to meet the sun,
as fast as if it ran out of a little spigot running it off, and the
poor plant baby dries up for want of deep moisture near its roots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>How shall we break these tubes (the sun’s lemon candy
stick)?</p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, Mary Frances!</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Cultivation.</span></p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Jiminy! what a long lesson!” exclaimed Billy,
wiping his forehead, “What’re you going to do for
me, Mary Frances, for all this wonderful instruction?”</p>

<p>“I’ll give a dinner in your honor, Professor, and
let you invite whom you please.”</p>

<p>“On one condition,” said Billy, “that every thing
we have will come out of your garden!”</p>

<p>“Agreed!”</p>

<p>“To-morrow we begin real work and put into
practice some of these remarkable lectures,” added
Billy earnestly.</p>

<p>“Oh, how glad I am!” exclaimed Mary Frances.
“Billy, it seems too wonderful! My, I’m glad
Mother and Father sent you away to school, though
I did miss you terribly, but you learned such a lot
that it makes up for it.”</p>

<p>“Augh! Mary Frances, you make a fellow feel
queer, I wasn’t such a perfect little <i>angel</i> in <i>school</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, certainly not, certainly not, Billy,” laughed
Mary Frances, “that’s the wonder of it—to think
a bad boy like you could learn so much, that’s the
puzzle to me.”</p>

<p>“Humm!” said Billy to himself as he looked
after Mary Frances’ fleeting figure, “It’s lucky for
that girl that I’m a scout.”</p>

weeds and grass cuttings.</p>

<p>“Why, Feather Flop,” she exclaimed, “I haven’t
seen you for ever-so-long! Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been—I’ve been—watching,” said Feather
Flop, “and when I’ve thought I dared, I’ve weeded
your garden; yes, I have. Haven’t you noticed how
few weeds there were?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I have, Feather Flop, indeed I have; only the
other day I said to Billy, ‘I almost could imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
someone had been “cultivating” the garden this
morning.’”</p>

<p>“That was the morning I got up before daylight,
and went out there and scratched, and scratched,
where I felt <i>sure</i> I would not disturb anything which
ought not to be disturbed,” said Feather Flop,
delighted.</p>

<p>“My,” said Mary Frances, “how perfectly dear
of you, Feather Flop; I can’t begin to tell you the
wonderful fairy-story-feeling I have, to know that
all the time that Billy and I are studying and working,
you are so interested and kind, so anxious to
help me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, dear Miss,” sighed the happy rooster;
“but I certainly do wish I could do more and be with
you oftener.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Feather Flop,” said the little girl.
“Some day when Billy goes to town, we’ll spend the
whole day together.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Feather Flop, delighted. “Good!
and now, please let me show you where I found so
many cutworms.”</p>

<p>Mary Frances and he walked over to the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Right there,” explained Feather Flop, going toward
the tomato plants and pointing with his wing:
“right down there. About twenty, I guess there
were, and I had some difficulty——”</p>

<p>“Get out of that garden, will you, Feather Flop!”
roared Billy, coming with a stick. “Say, Mary
Frances, why don’t you chase that old good-for-nothing
rooster off? If he doesn’t look out——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy,” cried Mary Frances. “Oh, Billy,
you ought—he was—he has eaten a lot of cutworms.
I know he has! You don’t understand!”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand! Well, I guess I don’t!
Get out of here, you old busybody of a rooster!”
said Billy.</p>

<p>Mary Frances felt so sorry about the rooster she
couldn’t have helped crying, and out came her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy,” she sobbed, “he’s so interested—in
the—garden.”</p>

<p>“I should say he is!” said Billy. “I should say
so! But whatever can be the matter with <i>you</i>, gets

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The calyx cup has five pointed scallops.</p>

<p>Each scallop is called a <span class="u">sĕp´-ăl</span>.</p>

<p>Little Buttercup wears not only a beautiful yellow collar
corolla made of shiny yellow petals, held in place by the green
sepals of the calyx cup, but she has a lovely necklace of fringe
close about her neck.</p>

<p>Each thread of fringe is a stā´-men.</p>

<p>Each stamen is made of a thread called a <span class="u">fĭl´-ă-mĕnt</span>, and
on the end of each filament dangles a little bead, called an <span class="u">ăn´-thẽr</span>.</p>

<p>Proud little Buttercup not only wears all of these beautiful
things, but she uses powder!</p>

<p>On each anther bead Little Buttercup carries some yellow
powder.</p>

<p>This powder is called <span class="u">pŏl´-len</span>.</p>

<p>She must be very proud when she gets all dressed up in the
lovely Spring days in her best finery—a shiny corolla collar,
made of yellow petals, held in a calyx cup, made of green sepals,
and a stamen fringe necklace, powdered with pollen!</p>

<p>Oh, yes, she wears a lovely dress of green lacey leaves. The
leaf is made strong, just as children are, by a bone, a leaf-bone
or a <span class="u">mid-rib</span>.</p>

<p>All other flowers dress in a similar way, but not every flower
has as many beautiful things to wear as has little Buttercup.</p>

<p>When you see flowers after this, look for the lovely corolla,
calyx, stamens, and other parts of the flower, which you have
learned to know through Little Buttercup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>There is another part to a buttercup, called the <span class="u">pis-til</span>, but
I shall tell you about that part of flowers in the next lesson, in
just the way our teacher told us.</p></div>

<p>“Oh,” cried Mary Frances, as Billy finished,
“What a delightful lesson! Never again will buttercups
seem the same. Although I always loved them,
they will be so much more interesting after this.”</p>

radish seeds.</p>

<p>“Not so very,” answered Mary Frances, “but
I would like to take a little rest,” sitting down on
the garden bench. “Doesn’t everything look lovely—the
beds all laid out, and neat as biscuits in a baking
pan!”</p>

<p>“It is some garden, believe me!” agreed Billy,
wiping his brow. “I guess I’ll stop for a few minutes,
too,” throwing himself down at the foot of the
tree.</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy, you oughtn’t to lie there on the
ground,” chided Mary Frances; “you’ll take your
death of cold.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” roared Billy, getting up. “Yes,
Grandmother, certainly, your darling grandchild
understands your kind admonition and obeys,” taking
a seat beside Mary Frances, who made room for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Billy, don’t tease,” she begged. “Please
don’t! I’ve enjoyed my Garden Lessons so much,
and you’ve been so kind——”</p>

<p>“Say, Mary Frances, if you want me to go away,
just keep on praising me, will you,” interrupted Billy.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Mary Frances, “I’ll stop, but
I’ve gone over and over in my mind the lesson about
the seed babies. It all seems so wonderful to me.
Do you know, Billy, I’ve often wondered how the
little seed babies are made. Where does their mother
get them?”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Billy, “I guess I can explain.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” shrieked Mary Frances suddenly. “Oh,
Billy, excuse me, please, but that bee nearly dashed
in my face.”</p>

<p>“It’s not after you, Mary Frances,” laughed Billy.
“That’s good Mrs. Bee looking for honey. And
she’ll have hard work to find it to-day, I’m thinking.
Still, I saw a few very early blossoms out on the
shrubs at the end of the garden.”</p>

<p>“I saw them, too, Billy. Isn’t it lovely that we
have such beautiful things to enjoy.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Mrs. Bee thinks, too,” said Billy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
“and in fact, the flowers are made beautiful, not for
us especially, but to attract the bees and moths and
butterflies.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t imagine why,” said Mary Frances;
“the bees only steal honey from them.”</p>

<p>“Only steal honey!” exclaimed Billy. “But then,
I used to think so myself, Mary Frances, until about
a year ago, when I learned better. You see, the
bees do every bit as much for the flowers as the
flowers do for the bees.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do they? That’s wonderful, Billy. Please
tell me about it?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll move over far enough on this bench
to let me be comfortable,” growled Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly, certainly; excuse me.” Mary
Frances almost fell off the end. “Oh, say, Billy,
let’s go over under the trees and I’ll swing in the
hammock, and you can take the bench.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Billy, following Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Now,” suggested Mary Frances, settling herself
in the hammock, “I know you feel just like telling
me the whole story.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Billy, “and I have a surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
for you—I just caught that honey bee you saw. Here,
in my cap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s see it, Billy,” Mary Frances put out
her hand.</p>

<p>“Take care!” warned Billy. “I guess you forget
how a bee stings. Go get a large-mouth bottle and
I’ll slip it in.”</p>

<p>Billy gently slipped the bee into the large bottle
Mary Frances brought.</p>

<p>“Notice, Mary Frances, how furry its little body
is.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s covered with yellow!” exclaimed Mary
Frances. “I thought bees were rather dark in color.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Billy, “yes, this bee is quite dark
in color; the yellow you see is pollen powder.”</p>

<p>“Oh, off the anther bead!” exclaimed Mary
Frances. “It’s off the anther bead of some flower!”</p>

<p>“Guessed right that time,” said Billy. “That’s
what it is, all right. I wish I could tell you the whole
story of the bee and of fertilization the way Miss
Gardener told us in class.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Birth of Seed Babies. Formation of the Pistil</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The pistil is the tall green center stalk generally found in
the midst of the stamens.</p>

<p>The pistil is very interesting, for it has to do with
the way in which the seed baby is born.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, Mary Frances, I am going to cut a flower
off that geranium in the window, down the center to
show you. Mother will not object.”</p>

<p>When Billy had cut the flower down lengthwise
he explained further</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Need of Pollen</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now, the pistil needs pollen off the anthers of some other
flower in order to bring seed-babies to life. Oh, yes, Mary Frances,
I’m coming to the part about the bees. The pistil needs pollen,
as I said; sometimes a pistil needs the kind of pollen which is
on the anthers of the same plant, sometimes a pistil needs pollen
from the anthers of some other plant, but it must have pollen
to give seed babies life.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">How Can the Flowers Get Pollen</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now, flowers cannot walk, nor can the pistils or stamens
of flowers walk. How can they get the pollen powder to their
pistils? How can the pollen powder get to their pistils?</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Flowers Spread a Feast for Insects</span></h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>In some cases the breeze blows some pollen upon the pistils
of a few flowers, but it is a very <i>uncertain</i> way, to depend
on a breeze; so the wonderful flowers <i>spread a feast</i> of just the
most delightful food for <i>bees</i>, and sometimes for butterflies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
sometimes for moths; and not only do they get the most enticing
food ready for such insects, but they put out the most beautiful
signs telling them the feast is ready.</p>

<p>They make the sign just as attractive as they possibly can
for the particular kind of insect they wish to come to them to
eat.</p>

<p>They use the loveliest colors and the most delightful odors,
which please the bees, the butterflies, the moths, more than they
please even you and me, by their wonderful beauty and fragrance.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nectar</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The food they give the bee is—no, Mary Frances, it is not
honey, it is <i>nectar</i>, out of which the bees make honey.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Honey Bee’s Honey-Churns</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yes, I know you want to learn how they make it. No,
they do not churn it in a churn; they really churn it, though.
That is a good guess. They churn it in their honey-sac stomachs.
The honey bees love pollen, too. It is their flour—pollen flour—and
they carry it to their hives in little basket-like places on
their legs.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Insects Carry Pollen</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now, the bees in coming to get this feast of good things
to eat—the nectar for honey, and the pollen for bee-flour, both
of which are very necessary for bees—do just exactly what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
flowers want them to do above everything—<i>to carry pollen</i> from
some anthers to the pistil. This they do without knowing what
a great kindness they are bestowing upon the flowers.</p>

<p>They think they are just doing their duty in gathering nectar
to make honey and pollen for bee-flour, but in dipping their
heads down into the deep calyx where the nectar is stored, they
get their furry bodies covered with pollen, and when they come
out of that flower, or go to visit another, they spread pollen all
over the stigma of the pistil! And when the pollen is spread on
the stigma of the pistil, somehow, in some wonderful way it sinks
down through the style into the ovary where the dear little seed
baby is born.</p>

<p>If you cut open an old bloom going to seed you will see a
number of seed babies in the ovary from which they will fall
when they are ripe.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bumble Bees Help</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sometimes flowers are very particular as to just what insect
shall do this work for them. For instance, the clover hides
its nectar too deep for the honey bee’s tongue to reach; so the
bumble bee and butterfly do most of the work of pollination for
the clovers.</p>

<p>The little butter-and-eggs flower depends upon bumble
bees, too, to bring pollen to the pistil, for she closes the nectar
holder with so tight a lip that the weight of the honey bee is not
heavy enough to open it.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Animals Would Starve Without This Work of Insects</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the way, it is a dreadful thing to kill bumble bees. They
do the work of pollenizing for many a deep-cupped flower, and
<i>without their aid and the aid of some such insects, everybody would
starve</i>, for there would be no seed and no new plants to take the
place of the old ones as they died, and animals and birds and
mankind would perish of starvation.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Moths and Butterflies Help, Too</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This work of pollenizing depends for the most part on bees,
but many butterflies and moths feed on nectar in the same way.
Most moths’ tongues are very long, and many long-necked flowers
depend upon them to bring pollen on their soft, furry bodies to
the pistils. The moths fly at night, so many long-necked flowers,
like the moonflowers, do not open their blooms nor shed their
sweet odors in the day time, but wait to show their sweetness
until their favorite insect is flying.</p>

<p>Now you see that Beauty Butterfly and night moths are
not just a gorgeous bit of living color. Such moths and Beauty
Butterfly accomplish much good.</p></div>

<p>“Well, Miss Gardener said she lay out in the
hammock, just as you are lying, Mary Frances, studying
just what I have told you, only in a much more
difficult way, and she kept saying over and over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
herself, ‘Corolla, calyx, sepals, stamens, pistil,’ in
order that she might know her lesson, when all at
once her book began to slip out of her hand and she
could not seem to cling to it at all. She heard the
dull thud as it hit the ground.”</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” asked a strange buzzy voice. “I’m
always in a hurry, you see. Are you quite ready?”</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” answered Miss Gardener; “ready
for anything; but please, where are you, who are
you, and what am I to be ready for?”</p>

<p>And again the buzzy voice spoke: “Ready to go
with me?”</p>

<p>Miss Gardener looked around toward where the
buzzy voice seemed to come from. There, sitting on
a rose nearby, was a honey bee.</p>

<p>“Oh,” gasped Miss Gardener, “I’m—that is—I——”</p>

<p>“You’re afraid!” buzzed the bee, coming near
her. “You’re afraid I’ll sting you!” She laughed.
“We never sting unless we think we need to take care
of ourselves or our lovely children.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” apologized Miss Gardener, “I—that is,
I—I’m ready, Mrs. Bee.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, then,” buzzed the bee, flying nearer.
“Are you certain you’re not afraid?”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” declared Miss Gardener; but she
said a little shiver went down her spine.</p>

<p>“Very well,” buzzed the bee, coming straight
at her and hitting her between the eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Gardener tried to scream; before she could
do so she had the queerest sensation. Before she
could think whether the bee had stung or not, she
began to sink down, down, down, down, down, down,
until she was just the size of the bee.</p>

<p>“You’ve wondered so long,” said the bee, “about
what a beehive was like inside, I am going to take
you on a visit to ours. But we must hurry, or I shall
not get my duty to the hive people done. Besides,
you cannot enter without some pollen or nectar; so
here, stop and get a bit.”</p>

<p>“How can I?” began Miss Gardener.</p>

<p>“Fly over to that rose I was on,” said the bee.
Miss Gardener flew and gathered some pollen, and,
together, Mrs. Honey Bee and she winged their way
over to the hive.</p>

<p>There are two thousand different kinds of bees known at the
present time, but the most useful and best understood are the honey
bees. The homes (usually wooden boxes) furnished by man for
bees are called hives, but the wild bees live ordinarily in hollow
trees or caves. The prettiest and gentlest family of the honey
bees are the Italian Bees.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think you lead a busy life. If you worked
from earliest morning to dark you could not be busier than good
Mrs. Honey Bee, for she never trifles nor wastes a minute.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think she goes leisurely from flower to flower,
sipping the sweet nectar, and has a very delightful time simply
enjoying herself.</p>

<p>You are mistaken, then, for the worker honey bee is not
thinking of herself at all, except to eat just enough to keep her
well.</p>

<p>She is working for the good of the whole Bee family, and
especially for the little Baby Bees.</p>

<p>You begin to see in all your studying, that almost all living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
things seem to live with the purpose of helping baby things like
themselves to live.</p>

<p>So good Mrs. Bee is not gathering honey and pollen bee-flour
to “gobble” them up, but is going to pack much of them away
for the use of the bees who will live over winter, and for the
baby bees, and for the male bees who have no way of gathering
food from the flowers for themselves.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Bee City</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Beehive city is a wonderfully busy place.</p>

<p>From twenty thousand to forty thousand, or more, inhabitants
live in the Bee City, so no wonder it is a busy place.
You would think that everything would be in confusion, but
on the contrary everything is in marvelous law and order.
Every inhabitant knows just what part it is expected to do,
and each kind of inhabitant is particularly fitted to do its own
particular part.</p>

Quite a number of Drone Bees.</td></tr>
</table></div></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Queen Bee</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Queen Bee is the mother bee, and it is her duty to lay
eggs, out of which Baby Bees are hatched.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Worker Bees</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Worker Bees do the work of the Beehive City. They
gather food, and feed and care for the inhabitants, and keep the
city clean.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Drone Bees</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Drone or male Bees do not work. Their bodies help
keep the hive warm, but they cannot do any real work. One
of them is the husband of the Queen Bee, but after she first
marries him she doesn’t pay any attention to him. She is too
busy laying eggs in the cradle cells the Worker Bees have made.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Why the Workers Kill the Drones</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yes, it is expensive to feed the Drone Bees, and when the
weather begins to turn cool, perhaps in September or October,
the Worker Bees who up to that time have cared for the Drones,
begin to rid the Hive City of them. They bite off their wings,
and bite them in half sometimes—anything to kill them or send
them away. No, it is not as cruel as it sounds, for you see, if
Drone Bees kept on living they would eat up the honey which
is so much needed in the Winter by the Worker Bees and the
Queen who live over to care for the new Baby Bees in the Spring.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Wonderful Bodies of the Bees</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now, each different kind of honey bee has a body which
is particularly fitted to the work it has to perform.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Body of the Worker Bee</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Worker Bee, the one you see so often on flowers, has
a body made especially for the kind it is to do. It has many
excellent eyes which look to you like but two eyes, unless you
see them under the magnifying glass, and wonderful an-ten-næ,
and a tongue in its head. The antennæ are its horn-like feelers,
and they resemble your arms in the way they reach out, and
examine objects by “handling” them.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Antennæ</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The antennæ are so delicate that the bee can tell the shape and
size of any object by just passing them over it. On the antennæ
are smell-hollows with which the bee “scents out” the honey.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Legs, Wings, and Claws</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the bee’s body, as you know, are the legs and wings. At
the end of each leg is a pair of claws.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pollen Baskets</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On each hind leg of the Worker Bee is a hollow in which
she packs the pollen flour which she gathers. These are the
pollen baskets.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Wings</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The front pair of wings is larger than the hind pair, and
often in older bees who have done much work, the edges are
frayed and torn.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Industry of the Worker</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Worker Bee does not live often over five weeks. She
actually works herself to death!</p>

<p>Just think. A bee has to visit nearly one hundred flowers
to fill her honey-sack with nectar, and when it is full, it does not
contain a full drop!</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wax Pockets</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Under the body of the Worker Bee are the little wax pockets.
The wax is very important, as it is used to make the cells in
which the honey is stored, and the cells in which the eggs are
laid.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Honey-Sac</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The honey, you remember, is carried to the hive in the
honey-sac of the Worker Bees.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Body of the Queen Bee</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Queen Bee, or Mother Bee, is longer than the Worker
Bee and has a tapering, graceful body. She has no pollen basket,
because it is not part of her work to gather pollen or honey,
her work being to lay eggs—sometimes as many as three thousand
in twenty-four hours, equal to about twice her own weight!</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Sting</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Both the Worker Bees and the Queen Bee have a sting to
use as a weapon of defense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>When enemies, such as mice, or moths, or bees from other
hives get into the hive to steal honey, the sting is very much
needed by the Worker Bees, as you can easily see.</p>

<p>The Queen uses her sting in a different way, as I shall tell
you later on.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Body of the Drone</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Drone Bee differs much in appearance from the Worker
and Queen, his body being broad and blunt. His eyes are very
large and wings strong. He has no wax pockets nor pollen
pockets. His tongue is not long enough to get honey from the
flowers. He cannot even find food for himself, and when driven
out of the hive, as sometimes in the Autumn, he starves to death
in a short time.</p></div>

<small><span class="smcap">How the Bees Work</span></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">AS I said, the work in the Beehive City is
divided up.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Worker Bees are divided into various groups: who
forage for nectar; who gather pollen; who guard the entrance
to the hive from enemies; who clean the city; who build the
comb; the nurse-bees, who feed the babies; the undertakers,
who carry away the dead; and a group whose duty it is to fan
the air to keep the hive cool.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Ventilating Workers—The Fanners</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They keep their tiny wings vibrating so rapidly that sometimes
the draught they make will put out a lighted candle flame
held at the entrance of the hive at night.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Comb Builders</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When a colony or swarm of bees first enter their new home
or hive, the comb builders set about making the comb. The
comb is formed of food-cells, in which to store honey and pollen;
and cradle cells, in which the queen may lay her eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The comb (cells) is made of beeswax—yes, the kind that
your mother uses on her sewing thread sometimes.</p>

<p>After getting in the right position on the coiling of the hive
(for bees build downward), the bees take from their wax pockets
some little scales of wax, and begin kneading and chewing them
into the correct degree of softness, and they or their helpers fix
it in position. They make the cells six-sided, and there is no
wasted space.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Queen’s Work</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All the time the comb builders have been working, the
queen has wandered about in an excited way. When she sees
that there are cells ready for her, she begins to lay eggs. She
is attended by a number of bees who clean her, and massage her,
and wait upon her, and feed her “royal jelly.”</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Worker Baby Bees</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In three or four days each egg (which looks like a tiny
grain of rice) hatches into a little white grub, and later the nurse
bees begin to feed it—no, not honey, but a kind of milk—honey
bee milk—which the nurses make. The little grub feeds on this
for three days, then is given richer bee-milk, and grows very
rapidly, turning into a chrysalis on the fifth or sixth day. It
spins around itself a silken cocoon, and is sealed into its cell by
another set of worker bees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>In about two weeks it turns into a full-fledged worker bee;
but there she is all sealed up in the cell. How can she get out?</p>

<p>It doesn’t take long for her to discover she has a sharp pair
of jaws, and she bites her way out. She is very pale and weak,
so the nurse bees begin to clean and feed her.</p>

<p>As soon as she gains strength, she gets right to work on some
task like feeding grub-babies; and perhaps after two weeks of
such work, she flies away to gather nectar.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Drone Baby Bee</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Drone Bee is hatched in the same way, only it takes
longer for him to become perfect.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Queen Baby or Princess</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But the Queen Bee is different.</p>

<p>When the worker bees decide they need a queen, the comb
builders make three or four queen cells, or “royal cradles,” which
are ordinary cells made large by cutting away parts of the next-door
cells and building a hanging cell.</p>

<p>In these larger cells are placed the eggs. When the first egg
is hatched, it is a princess bee.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Why Bees “Swarm”</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The old queen, knowing the princess will be the new queen,
“swarms” with the bees who wish to follow her to a new hive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The new queen, as soon as hatched, goes to the other royal
cells and stings the other little princesses (who might try to be
queen if they hatched) to death, and commences to be mother-queen
of the Bee City.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">How Bees Spend the Winter</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The bees spend the winter in a kind of sleep. They cluster
together to keep warm.</p>

<p>When the early Spring days come, and some of the bees
begin to bring in pollen and nectar, the queen begins to lay eggs.</p>

<p>These eggs will be hatched out into worker bees to carry
on the work of the hive, and the bees that lived over winter
will live only long enough to care for them until they can carry
on the work of the hive.</p></div>

<p>At length the Bee sighted her hive. “We are
home,” she said to Miss Gardener, “and I will explain
to the guard bees that it is all right for you to enter,
as you are one of us.”</p>

<p>Miss Gardener thanked her. They flew to the
Bee City entrance gate, and her new friend disappeared
within.</p>

<p>Miss Gardener just poked her head inside to see
how it seemed, when all the guard bees started toward
her, and the foremost one stung her and stung her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
until—she woke up shrieking, to find that there was
a hive of bees swarming on the tree just over her head.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Mary Frances, “did they sting her?”</p>

<p>“No, not really,” said Billy; “it was only a dream,
but somehow the fact that the bees were swarming
there must have made her dream of the stinging.”</p>

<p>“Well, I just believe Miss Gardener never had
to study the lesson about the bees,” said Mary Frances.
“I imagine her wonderful dream taught her.”</p>

<p>“But she was always sorry, she said, that she
did not get inside the hive in her dream,” replied
Billy.</p>

<p>“What wonderful little creatures bees are!” exclaimed
Mary Frances. “When people sell honey,
do they steal it from the bees?”</p>

<p>“Yes, practically that,” said Billy; “yet it is
not a serious theft, for the bees generally store up
much more honey than is needed, and the bee keeper
always leaves enough for them to use.”</p>

<p>“Billy, wouldn’t it be lovely to have a hive?”<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
said Mary Frances.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>“I’ve thought of it myself,” acknowledged Billy.
“One hive would make from four dollars upward in
a year, but I don’t think we’d better experiment along
any other line than gardening this year at least.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’re right, Billy,” laughed Mary
Frances, “although you’re a pretty good manager,
we don’t want too many ‘bees in our bonnets’ at one
time, do we? Oh, Billy, do you remember the verses
we used to say when we were little—</p>

<p>“That would please ’most any youngster,” remarked
Billy, as Mary Frances finished, “but I think it is
about time for us to let this honey bee fly away.
She is anxious, no doubt, to get to work,” as he opened
the bottle.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, good Mrs. Bee!” called Mary Frances

<p>The little plants had come up quite a
way through the soil.</p>

<p>With her hoe Mary Frances was drawing little
mounds of earth quite high around the stems of
the plants.</p>

<p>“Now, Mary Frances,” exclaimed Billy, “you’re
doing just wrong! That is one of the garden ‘don’ts.’
Don’t pile the earth high over the stems.”</p>

<p>“Why, if you please, Mr. Billy?” asked Mary
Frances.</p>

<p>“Because—” started Billy; then: “Oh, you must
know, Mary Frances.”</p>

<p>“I suppose because the little rootlets need rain,
and little hills would make the water run off,” guessed
Mary Frances, “and I’ll do it right after this; but,
really, Billy, I’m afraid I’ll never learn all my lessons
as well as you know yours. It is a marvel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
me how much you know. How you must have
studied!”</p>

<p>“Humm!” said Billy, hoeing away. “I did study;
but, somehow, I like gardening so much, it didn’t
seem hard work.”</p>

<p>“You must have worked hard, though, or you
wouldn’t have won that garden prize of five dollars
at school. Billy, you must feel rich! What are you
going to buy with it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll buy anything with what I
have left; it seems fine to me to just keep it in my
bank account.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” sighed Mary Frances, “I wish I could
make some money—not just save some of what is
given to me.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Why don’t I what?” Mary Frances looked up
from her work.</p>

<p>“Make some money,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“How could I?” asked Mary Frances in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Why, sell some of the vegetables you raise in
the garden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Billy! Billy!” cried Mary Frances. “Do
you suppose for a minute I could?”</p>

<p>“Course you could,” answered Billy, “if I helped
you, especially. I would like some spending money
myself. Suppose we go into partnership?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s!” cried Mary Frances. “How much
better than trying to do such a thing alone! And
I wouldn’t want you to help me unless we divided
the profits.”</p>

<p>“And I wouldn’t want to help you on any other
basis,” agreed Billy.</p>

<p>“But,” exclaimed Mary Frances suddenly, “what
about your own garden? You’ll not need any partnership
with me. You yourself will raise all you can
sell.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed what I have growing there,
Mary Frances?”</p>

<p>“Billy,” said the little girl shamefacedly, “I
haven’t. I haven’t noticed at all. How selfish
I am!”</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Billy, “I don’t mind at all, so
you needn’t feel bad, but I’ll tell you. Chiefly rhubarb
and asparagus; and they are both plants which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
need two years, or three, before they may be disturbed,
so you see why I’m so generous with my offer.”</p>

<p>“I understand now, Billy,” smiled Mary Frances.
“My, won’t you be rich when the rhubarb and
asparagus are ready to sell!”</p>

<p>“I do expect to make some money,” said Billy.
“Father said he would pay me something for what
is used by the family. It cost quite a sum to buy
the little plants I set out—all I spent of the prize
money was for them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly am glad you will help me,
Billy,” said Mary Frances, falling to work.</p>

<p>“All right; then it is settled,” Billy said. “It
won’t be long before that lettuce and those radishes
will be some size.”</p>

<p>“But the parsley bed has shown only the tiniest
little green leaves here and there! I wonder if it’s
never going to come up!” exclaimed Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“It often takes six weeks for parsley to germinate,”
explained Billy.</p>

<p>“Germinate?” inquired Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Billy, “for the seeds to grow—start
up, you know—wake up from their sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mary Frances, “I understand.” Then
suddenly, “Oh, Billy, I can scarcely wait until we
can begin to sell things! I believe, I really believe
I can cut some flowers to sell!”</p>

<p>“Certainly you can if they are beautiful enough!”
said Billy. “Well, I must make a start or else I’ll
never get over to the camp, and the fellows are down
on me now for being away so much. So long—get
all that hoeing done.”</p>

reach home,” called Mary Frances.</p>

<p>She was just going to sleep when she thought she
heard someone speak. Yes, it was Feather Flop,
and he seemed to be arguing with someone.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t talk to a stranger,” thought Mary
Frances, “I wonder who it is. I don’t dare peep,
for fear they’ll stop talking if they see me.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon the voices came nearer.</p>

<p>“I tell you,” Feather Flop was saying in a boastful
tone, “I tell you I am of the greatest benefit to
the garden.”</p>

<p>“If so, why so?” The question was asked in a
funny, croaking voice.</p>

<p>“If so, why so?” mimicked Feather Flop. “Because
it is so. So there!”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly, if saying so makes it so,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the voice. “But it is not so in my opinion. For
instance—pardon me till I catch that fly—how many
snails do you imagine I have eaten to-day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Feather Flop; “but I
do know this. I know I am the biggest benefit to
the garden.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, sir,” answered the other; “I think I
can easily prove I am the biggest benefit to the garden.”</p>

<p>“Cluck! Caw!” exclaimed Feather Flop. “You
mean you are the biggest toad in the puddle, Hoppy,
you poor old toad!”</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” thought Mary Frances. “So it’s a hop
toad! I just believe it’s that big fellow that lives
under the stepping stone. I think I’d know him.
I believe I’ll peep!”</p>

<p>She looked cautiously around the tree. “It is!
It is that same fellow I really believe! My, I wish
I could ask him some questions!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do not mean anything of the kind,
Mr. Feather Flop,” retorted the hop toad, and Mary
Frances could see his throat swell with indignation.
“I mean that I am actually and truly one of the
most helpful living things to have in a garden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, now, don’t get angry,” begged Feather
Flop, “I want to hear about that! I want to find
out, Hoppy, how you are more beneficial to the garden
than I am.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the hop toad, blinking his eyes
with a satisfied smile, “it’s this way: suppose I begin
with the baby toads——”</p>

<p>“A crow told me they taste very good,” interrupted
Feather Flop.</p>

<p>“For shame!” whispered Mary Frances. “Isn’t
that awful of Feather Flop!”</p>

<p>The rooster must have heard her, for he suddenly
bowed his head, saying, “Oh, I beg your pardon,
Hoppy—really I do! Please excuse me!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t know any better manners,”
answered the hop toad, “so I’ll have to excuse you,
and I’ll tell you—if you don’t interrupt—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Hop Toad</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My mother told me that one lovely day early in May she
awoke from her winter’s nap. Oh, yes, that’s what we do in
winter—sleep in the ground.</p>

<p>Well, my mother awoke, and went happily hopping down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to the meadow pond to lay some eggs. Perhaps you don’t
know them when you see them—toads’ eggs. They look like
tiny black pills in strings of transparent jelly. This jelly either
drops to the bottom of the pond or fastens to water weeds.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tadpoles</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The eggs grow larger and larger and pretty soon become
baby toads, or tadpoles.</p>

<p>Well, I was one of the tadpoles that spring, and my brothers
and sisters and I soon ate some of the jelly, and then some of
the delicious slime in the pond.</p>

<p>Yes, we lived in the water and breathed somewhat the way
fishes do.</p>

<p>When we were about ten days old, our mouths grew much
stronger and our jaws grew horny so that we could bite off pieces
of plants.</p>

<p>How lovely it was! I can remember now how cool and
pleasant it felt to swim about in the pond. We had long flat
tails which we used for swimming.</p>

<p>Now, Feather Flop, if you interrupt again I shall not finish
my story! No, we didn’t eat our tails; of course not. Our tails
were absorbed into our bodies to help with their growth.</p>

<p>When we were about an inch long we had but stump tails,
and found we had to come to the surface of the water for more
air every day, we decided we were no longer tadpoles, but real
hop toads. We swam to the shore of the pond and hopped away.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Toads’ Enemies</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Many of my little brothers and sisters, alas! were eaten by
snakes, and—yes, Feather Flop—gobbled up by crows.</p>

<p>No, Feather Flop, dogs wouldn’t bite us, because—do you
see the warts on my back? They are very useful to me. When
I want to disgust an enemy, I can send out of those warts a disagreeable,
biting secretion, and I am dropped pretty quickly.</p>

<p>No, of course, we cannot make warts on people’s hands.
No toad ever did anything of the kind! It’s a horrible untruth.
Certainly we seem cold to people’s touch. That’s because our
blood is of the same temperature as the air. Their blood is
warmer.</p>

<p>Well, as I said, almost any enemy drops one of us grown-up
toads quickly but snakes! They don’t seem to mind us at
all. Ugh! when I see one I either hop away with all my might,
or I bury myself in the earth. No, Feather Flop, I can’t teach
you how! I do it with my hind legs. See how I can kick!</p>

<p>There are two more ways in which we escape our enemies.</p>

<p>In the first place, if you notice carefully, you will observe
that I am almost the color of the leaves on which I am sitting.
If I should hop out there on the path, my coat would change in
a short time to nearly the color of the path. Oh, I do not care
to try it now. The sun is shining there, and I certainly do not
like sunlight and heat! The fact of our color being nearly the
shade of our surroundings prevents enemies from seeing us.
Yes, you are right, we shed our skins several times a year, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
swallow them. We generally do this when no one is looking.
The other way we escape notice is the fact that we feed mostly
at night, while our enemies are asleep.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">How Toads Help the Garden</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Speaking of food, Feather Flop—have you eaten any of
those delicious tent caterpillars? No? Well, you should try
some. Don’t you like them? They stick to your throat? Oh,
I didn’t know that, but I’ve noticed that you didn’t seem to
eat them, nor “thousand-leggers.” That’s the reason I said
I was of more benefit than you to the garden.</p>

<p>Just listen until I tell you what I had this early morning for
supper. No, not breakfast! I told you I feed at night. Early
morning brings my supper time! Well, these are what I had:</p>

<ul class="plants2"><li><a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>6 cutworms</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">5 thousand leg worms</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">6 sow bugs</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">9 ants</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">1 weevil</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">1 ground beetle</span></li></ul>

<p>We eat also snails, injurious beetles, grasshoppers, worms,
potato bugs, and lots more of harmful creatures. Well, ants
and spiders may be useful, but ants are a question, and we eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
few spiders. Spiders are lots of fun to catch, though. See,
there is one! See how my tongue shot out at him? My tongue
is fastened to the lower jaw at the front of my mouth. You
didn’t see it? Well, I suppose we toads do use our tongues pretty
quickly. They have a sticky substance spread over them, so
we’re pretty certain to make our “catch.”</p></div>

<p>“Now, Feather Flop, I think I’ve told you almost
everything. Is there anything else you’d like to
know?”</p>

<p>Mary Frances had been listening with all her
ears.</p>

<p>“My, there are things I’d like to know,” she
thought. “How I wish he’d talk to me!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Feather Flop in a crestfallen voice,
“I don’t think of any. I certainly must acknowledge
that you are usefuller than I thought!”</p>

<p>“Thanks! All right!” replied the toad, taking
a hop.</p>

<p>“Hold on, please, Hoppy!” Mary Frances ventured
to call.</p>

<p>The toad turned.</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Hop Toad,” she begged, “please
will you tell me something? I’ve overheard your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
wonderful story. If it is not too inquisitive, may
I ask why your throat puffs all the time?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly,” croaked the toad, “my
voice is hoarse, Miss, but I’ll do my best to answer.
You see, we toads have no ribs to use when we
breathe, so we have to swallow every bit of air we
use.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mary Frances, “that is it. I am so
much obliged to you for telling me. Here is a fish-worm—or
do you call them angle-worms, or earth-worms?—for
you!”</p>

<p>“A fish-worm!” exclaimed the toad. “That is
fine. Throw it down, please. No, that is the wrong
end toward me. Fish-worms wear rough rings along
their bodies which hurt the throat if swallowed the
wrong way foremost. They’re pretty large to get
down, so I may have to rub it down my throat with
my hands.”</p>

<p>This the funny little toad did, and after getting
it down, patted its little stomach. “My, it was
so good. I shut my eyes while I swallowed!” he
said.</p>

<p>Mary Frances laughed outright. “I’m glad I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
gave you a treat,” she said. “I wish I knew something
else I could do to make you happy.”</p>

<p>“Then just take a stick and scratch my back,
please.”</p>

<p>Mary Frances did as requested.</p>

<p>Feather Flop looked on all the while without a
word. At length he blurted out, “You told me,
little Miss, I think, that fish-worms were good for
the garden—that they stir the soil and make it light
and porous. I’ve never eaten one since you told me
that!”</p>

<p>He looked scornfully at the toad.</p>

<p>Mary Frances smiled. “Oh, Feather Flop, indeed
I thank you, but you see, we don’t need so many
of them. You could take one once in a while.”</p>

<p>“I must be going,” said the toad, “and I thank
you, Miss. You’re much more polite and kind
than some people I’ve known!” glancing at the
rooster.</p>

<p>“He means the boy that stoned him,” said Feather
Flop.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, I did not refer to him,” said the
toad; “but really, boys are terribly hard on us!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
And think of all we do to help them. We eat the
dreadfully destructive insects.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if my brother Billy ever—” began
Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“No, not any more,” said the toad. “I’ve lived
here in this garden five years and it’s over a year
since he’s troubled any of us.”</p>

<p>“He never will again,” promised Mary Frances.
“I shall certainly tell him your story.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, and thank you very much!” suddenly
exclaimed the toad, hopping away very
rapidly.</p>

<p>“Oh,” called Mary Frances, “I want to ask you
something else. Won’t you talk to us again?”</p>

<p>This time the toad did not turn around nor answer
a word, but hopped more rapidly than ever.</p>

<p>“I can catch him!” exclaimed Feather Flop, “and
I’ll peck him as hard as ever I can, too, for treating
you that way!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare, Feather Flop,” called Mary
Frances, running after him. “I’m ashamed of you!”
catching him up.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” sighed Feather Flop, “and I wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to help you so much! I am always doing something
wrong!”</p>

<p>“Listen, Feather Flop,” explained Mary Frances,
“that probably frightened him so he’ll never speak
again.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be to blame for that, too,” mourned Feather
Flop. “Oh, I’m sorry, so sorry.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, my friend,” said Mary Frances;
“I appreciate the kindness you meant to show even
if you made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you forgive me, little Miss?” asked
the rooster.</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” answered Mary Frances. “But I
can’t promise about the hop toad!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a hop about Hoppy,” said the
rooster, “just so you forgive me.”</p>

<p>“I guess a rooster, even if as clever as Feather
Flop, can’t understand such things,” mused Mary
Frances to herself.</p>

<p>“Please be polite to him for my sake, then,” she
said.</p>

<p>“I will! indeed I will!” promised Feather Flop.</p>

Mary Frances finished telling him the story
of the hop toad, “If he mentioned cutworms
among the insects he eats, I certainly am glad to
make his acquaintance. Will you introduce me to

<p>“Certainly I will, Billy; come right down into

<p>The children looked all over the place for the hop
toad, but were unable to find a trace of him.</p>

<p>“I remember,” said Mary Frances, “that he told
me he slept in the day time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” replied Billy, “that’s the reason
we don’t see him. I might have thought of that!”</p>

<p>“Hello, he’s been lazing on the job though,” he
exclaimed. “Look at those three young tomato
plants, all cut off near the roots. Neat work, that.
Mr. Cutworm the Villain’s, I’ll bet!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Billy, won’t they grow up again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not much!” exclaimed Billy. “No, indeed;
we’ll have to put in new ones in their place. We’ve
had so little trouble with cutworms that I forgot to
take precaution.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Precaution—why, means to keep him from the
plants. We could have used—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Paper Collars to Protect Plants from Cutworms</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cut strong paper into rectangles about 2½ x 5 inches.
Wrap a paper loosely around the stem of growing tomato plants
and other tender stems before packing the earth around them.
Let the paper extend about an inch above the ground, but make
it narrower if it covers the roots.</p></div>

<p>“Oh, how funny,” laughed Mary Frances, “for
plants to wear paper collars.”</p>

<p>“They would cheat Mr. Cutworm out of several
good meals,” said Billy. “It’s provoking to
find plants cut off that way. You see, the worms do
their villainous work at night!”</p>

<p>“Oh, do they live under ground all the time?”</p>

<p>“No, we learned in school that they are the larvæ,
or young, of a certain night-flying moth. They live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in the ground until they change into cocoons (or
worms-in-cases), which they weave about themselves.
Finally the cocoon comes out of the case as a moth.
Here is a picture of the villain.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” shuddered Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Hello, here is the real thing,” exclaimed Billy
as he kicked aside some earth.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t he ugly!” exclaimed Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“We’d never preserve him for his beauty,” agreed
Billy. “Some farmers make poison bait for cutworms
by mixing a little poison and molasses with
bran or clover, and throw it on the ground at night
when birds and chickens have gone to bed. They
are careful to take it up early in the morning so that
no other creature will get it by mistake.”</p>

been in the garden there wouldn’t have
been so many cutworms.”</p>

<p>“Mary Frances!” exclaimed Billy. “How ridiculous!
You don’t seem to understand that that old
rooster would have eaten up all the young plants
himself!”</p>

<p>Mary Frances bit her lip to keep from laughing
as she saw Feather Flop peeping around the tree in
back of Billy.</p>

<p>“If that rooster were a robin or a wren it would
be different,” went on Billy. “Just listen, Mary
Frances!” pulling a paper out of his pocket.</p>

<p>“‘One robin has been known to feed his family
five yards of worms a day.</p>

<p>“‘A chicka-dee will dispose of 5500 eggs of the
canker-worm moth in one day.</p>

<p>“‘A flicker eats no less than 9000 ants a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘A pair of wrens have been seen to carry 100
insects to their young in an hour. They are especially
fond of plant lice and cutworms.</p>

<p>“‘Little humming birds lick plant lice off foliage
with lightning rapidity.</p>

<p>“‘The yellow-billed cuckoo eats hundreds of tent
caterpillars in a day.</p>

<p>“‘Seed-eating birds destroy myriads of seeds of
destructive weeds—actually eating hundreds of tons
of seed.</p>

<p>“‘The Department of Agriculture of the United
States estimates that the tree sparrow alone saves the
American farmer $90,000,000 in a year by eating
seeds of weeds.’”</p>

<p>“That isn’t the English sparrow,” laughingly interrupted
Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Billy, “not so much can be said in
its favor.”</p>

<p>“How do people know what the different birds
eat?” asked Mary Frances. “Did someone watch to
see what each different bird took for a meal?”</p>

<p>“No.” Billy referred to his clipping. “Scientists
have examined the contents of the stomachs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
birds, and have learned what food each kind of bird
uses. There was a time when people imagined that
robins stole so many cherries and berries that it was
a good deed to kill them. Now they have found that
they destroy so many injurious insects that they do
not begrudge them a few cherries. Besides, if mulberry
trees are planted nearby, they will prefer their
fruit to the cherries.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy,” cried Mary Frances, “isn’t it wonderful!
Not only do birds help us by destroying
harmful insects and seeds, but they help us
by their beauty. I believe they are the most
beautiful of living things! They could have helped
us just as much, and have been as ugly as—cutworms.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Billy, “I believe that is so, but
it takes a girl to think such things out. The most
remarkable fact to me, however, is that without
birds we would die of starvation. It has been estimated
that if they were absent for one season alone, the United
States would lose over $300,000,000, and if they disappeared
entirely, agriculture and farming would be
impossible within a few years.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bees and birds,” commented Mary Frances softly,
“keep us from starving. How wonderful it all seems.
Why, Billy, it must have all been planned out when
God made the world!”</p>

<p>“I have thought of that myself, Mary Frances,”
said Billy; “it’s one of those thoughts a
fellow doesn’t often speak out loud. I don’t know
why.”</p>

<p>“Everybody ought to take care of birds,” went
on Mary Frances. “Surely the reason they don’t,
is because they do not understand how wonderfully
they help us. Do you recall Miss Carey’s
poem—‘An Order for a Picture’? I learned a part
of it in my literature course last winter:</p>

of doing such a thing. I aimed a stone at the little

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Billy. “Ladybird or ladybug;
but why they are given so charming a name, I can’t
imagine.”</p>

<p>“I can imagine, Billy. Have you ever noticed,
besides being so very pretty, how neat they are; how
ladylike they look when they fold their wing covers
and tuck in their inside wings; and did you ever see
them wash themselves? They do it so carefully!
I don’t wonder at their being named Ladybirds.”</p>

enviable imagination. I should say they were more
fittingly named Possumbugs. Have you ever noticed
how they ‘play possum’ when you try to pick
them up?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I have,” Mary Frances laughed at the
remembrance. “Maybe they do that to save their
lives just as opossums do; but they are so very
pretty that I’d call them Ladybirds for that reason
alone.”</p>

dresses with red or yellow polka, dots; sometimes
the dress is yellow with black spots.”</p>

“I never tried the rhyme on any but the red ones

asked Billy.</p>

blow your breath upon them, they fly away; if you
just watch them, they generally turn around and
run as fast as they can in the opposite direction from
which they were going.”</p>

<p>“Probably looking for food,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Probably running to save their children’s lives.”
Mary Frances was quite indignant.</p>

<p>“Perhaps my notes will tell,” said Billy, opening
his note book again and beginning to read:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ladybirds or Ladybugs</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Ladybird is a little beetle about a third of an inch long.
There are many species of ladybirds; they all are of the same
general shape, somewhat like a split pea, but much smaller.
They are usually of brilliant shiny colors with spots of contrasting
colors: sometimes red with black spots; sometimes black with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
red or yellow spots, sometimes yellow with black spots. The
young or larvæ of the ladybird are not in the least like their
mothers. They are little black, rough, worm-like creatures with six
legs, having reddish-yellow or rusty spots on their backs. Both the
young and the parents are very helpful to the garden because they
eat harmful insects—scale insects and aphids or green plant lice.</p>

<p>One species of ladybird which the California fruit growers
brought from Australia has been the means of exterminating a
scale insect very injurious to the orange and lemon trees of the
Western coast. The larva of the ladybird turns into a hard encased
pupa, and later into a full-grown ladybird insect.</p></div>

<p>“My,” exclaimed Mary Frances, “another garden
friend! Why, Billy, one is never alone in the garden.
There are always lots of friends about.”</p>

<p>“And enemies too,” said Billy. “Some time I’ll
tell you about one of the silliest of enemies, which Professor
Weed called an ‘animated honey drop’ or aphis.”</p>

<p>“Tell me now, Billy? Oh, do tell me now!”</p>

<p>“Not much! Not much! Some other time, Mary
Frances. Do you think I’m an animated encyclopedia—always
ready to deal out information, or do
you think—? Oh, so long!”</p>

<p>Before Mary Frances could answer, Billy had
disappeared.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“JUST in the nick of time,” said Billy as Mary
Frances came racing with Eleanor around the
front of the house. “Why, hello! who’s here?
Excuse me, Eleanor, I didn’t know you were to
arrive until this afternoon,” shaking hands with
Mary Frances’ “best girl friend.”</p>

<p>“She wasn’t expected until afternoon,” explained
Mary Frances, “but some friends of her father’s
were coming this way in their car, so she’s here quite
early. Oh, I’m so glad!” as she kissed Eleanor
again.</p>

<p>“I wish we’d never moved away, Mary Frances,”
said Eleanor, returning her embrace.</p>

<p>“You said I was just in the nick of time, Billy,”
Mary Frances suddenly exclaimed. “Why, so is
Eleanor. We can share the secret with her!”</p>

<p>“Another of Mary Frances’ secrets!” cried Eleanor.
“Please tell me about it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary Frances makes so much out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
nothing,” said Billy. “It’s simply this: we’re planting
a garden, and don’t want the folks to know
it.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t all, Eleanor,” said Mary Frances,
“Billy is teaching me how to garden. He took a
course in gardening last year, and he explains to me
everything his professors taught him.”</p>

<p>“Jiminy!” exclaimed Billy. “Everything! Well,
not much! I’m trying to tell her just a little bit
of what they tried to teach us fellows. By the way,
doesn’t Bob garden?”</p>

<p>Eleanor began to giggle. The children looked at
her in surprise. Finally she answered: “Such gardening!
Believe me—no garden can raise a crop of
weeds equal to his. I must tell you what I was
laughing at. Early in the Spring Bob planted in a
box some seed one of the boys had given him, and
Father allowed him to put it in the sunniest window.
He watered and tended it, and finally set the little
plants out. The fellows told him that he’d be surprised
at the wonderful plants he’d get; that he could
have them served as ‘greens’ for our dinner.”</p>

<p>“What were they?” interrupted Mary Frances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed Billy, who was much interested.
“Eleanor will come to that soon.”</p>

<p>“Well, the plants certainly did grow! They grew
large, broad leaves, quite curly, but no one seemed
to know what they were. One day Bob asked the
farmer who sold us potatoes to look at his garden,
and I’ll never, never forget how that man laughed.
He roared; he shook; he doubled up with laughter.
He struck his knee with his hand, and tried to speak,
but no words would come. Bob looked on at first with
amazement, and then with anger, finally with disgust.</p>

<p>“‘If you wouldn’t mind telling the joke,’ he said,
‘we might share in the fun.’</p>

<p>“In a few moments the farmer spoke: ‘Well, sir,’
he said, ‘that’s the finest crop of curly dock weed
I ever seen!’ and he began to laugh again.”</p>

<p>“My, I bet Bob was ‘sore’!” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was, but that wasn’t the best of the
joke,” Eleanor went on.</p>

<p>“‘I’ll serve a mess of it to those fellows!’ he cried.
‘And Dick Willoughby’s got to eat the most—even
if I’m compelled to have the doctor there to keep
him from being poisoned.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘That would be a treat,’ the farmer said.
‘Curly dock makes one of the best “greens” in the
Spring. Just boil the leaves until tender, and serve
like spinach. Only, young feller, next time you want
a mess, just come over and weed out my meadow.
Don’t you take up your time and your pa’s land
a-cultivating what grows wild and can be had without
the asking.’”</p>

<p>“Well, Eleanor,” said Mary Frances, “you’ll be
able to teach Bob a lot about gardening if Billy will
let you share the lessons he’s been giving me. By
the way, Billy, what did you mean by ‘just in the
nick of time’?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” replied Billy, “only I wanted
to show you some of the ‘animated drops of honey’
about which I spoke.”</p>

<p>“Oh, where are they?” cried Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“What in the world do you mean, Billy?” Eleanor
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Follow me if you want to know,” commanded Billy,
leading the way to one of his mother’s rose bushes.</p>

<p>He lifted a long new branch.</p>

<p>“How funny the tip looks!” exclaimed the girls.
“All bristling, like a burr.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look more closely,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy,” laughed Mary Frances. “Billy, it’s
not a green burr at all! It looks that way because
of thousands of those little tiny green plant lice!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” acknowledged Billy, “nothing but aphids.
I’ll now try to repeat a little of our lesson on—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Aphids or Plant Lice</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are several species of aphids, but those most commonly
seen are little green ones.</p>

<p>Nearly all delight in feeding upon the sap of young tender<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
shoots. They thrust their tiny sharp beaks into the stem, and,
with their hind legs or claws in the air, suck the juices into their
soft little bodies. The sap is turned into honey-dew in their
stomachs, and ants use them for their cows! But they give
them honey, and not milk. Perhaps ants like honey-milk better
than we like cow’s milk. Aphids seem very insignificant. They
are helpless little creatures, and are very easily killed. Indeed,
they are so stupid they don’t seem to know when they are being
killed. Even though they are stupid, they do a great amount
of harm in the garden, stealing the vital fluids of the plants.</p>

<p>They multiply so rapidly that their many enemies do not
do away with all of them, so almost all gardeners use a “spray”
to kill them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most interesting of their enemies is the—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Aphis-lion</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This little worm-like creature is hatched from the egg of
the mother lace-wing, an airy green fly with light lacey wings.
She places eggs on a leaf nearby a group of aphids. The little
creature that is hatched is very hungry and immediately begins
to look for food.</p>

<p>It seizes the first aphis it can find in its strong pincers, and
lifting it high in the air, drinks the honey juice in its body with
great enjoyment.</p></div>

<p>“Greater than Mary Frances shows when drinking
chocolate soda?” queried Eleanor.</p>

<p>“That’s a question,” laughed Billy. “I’ve never
seen many aphis-lions eat, but I have seen Mary
Frances drink chocolate sodas ‘galore.’”</p>

<p>“But, Billy,” reminded Mary Frances, after they
had finished laughing, “you haven’t told us what
other enemies the aphids have, nor what you mean
by using a spray.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you stop to think, you’ll realize that spiders
and several different kinds of birds will eat them.
They are such stupid little creatures that it’s not
difficult to find or catch them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what about spraying—is that difficult?”
asked Eleanor. “You see, I want to surprise Bob
with my superior knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy, do give us just as many lessons as
you can possibly squeeze into the time Eleanor visits
us, won’t you?” cried Mary Frances. “Do tell us
about spraying or any other thing we ought to learn
about gardening.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mary Frances, you talk as though I knew
a lot on the subject!” said Billy, “when, as a matter
of fact, I don’t begin to know anything. It seems
to me that the more I study, the more there is to
learn.</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” he went on, “to tell you girls what
I can remember of what Professor Weed told about
insect pests and insecticides—but I do wish you
were both boys!”</p>

<p>“We don’t, though. Do we, Eleanor?” said Mary
Frances. “I shouldn’t think you’d mind. You’re
always with boys during the school term, and—I
don’t believe they’d listen anything like as well as
Eleanor and I will.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Garden Pests</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If we examine the various insects which injure plants, we
find they do the harm in two different ways, according to their
method of feeding. The different methods of feeding are by—</p>


<ul class="plants2"><li>(<i>a</i>) biting; or,</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) sucking.</li></ul>



<p><i>Biting insects</i> have <i>mandibles</i>, or jaws.</p>

<p>The biting insects most familiar to you are beetles, grasshoppers,
and many “worms,” or larvæ.</p>

<p>If you catch a grasshopper, and hold a blade of grass in an
upright position close to its mouth, you will observe that the jaws
do not move up and down, but sidewise. This is true of all insects.</p>

<p>It is quite easy to see the holes in leaves, bark, flowers or
fruit where biting insects have been feasting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sucking insects</i>, instead of jaws, have a <i>haustellum</i> or proboscis,
which is a sucking tube, or beak, somewhat like a sharp
hollow bristle.</p>

<p>This they use to thrust down through outer layers of bark
or leaves into the inner tissues where they draw up the sap or
lifeblood of the plant.</p>

<p>Among the sucking insects are aphids and scale insects.</p>

<p>Now, it is an easy matter to throw poison on the parts of
the plants that biting insects devour, where they will eat and
swallow it, and then die; but it is almost impossible to place
poison in the inner portions of the plants where sucking insects
feed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, most sucking insects have soft bodies which
are easily destroyed; but it is a rather difficult task to do this
work of destruction of sucking insects, because every insect must
be touched by the destroying material to smother it, or destroy
its breathing pores. Every farmer is familiar with some insecticides,
or insect poisons.</p>

<p>The trouble with using poisons, however, is that most poisons
which will kill insects will also kill people, so it is better for young
gardeners to use remedies harmless to human beings, but deadly
to insects, of which there are a few.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>Insecticides or insect poisons are applied to plants in two
ways: by—</p>

<ul class="plants2"><li>(<i>a</i>) dusting with powder; or,</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) spraying with a liquid.</li></ul>

<p>A “sulphur gun” is a great help in applying powder; although
an old can with holes in the top may be used as a sprinkler.</p>

<p>Liquid sprays may be applied with a patent “sprayer,”
which may be purchased from any seed house; or with a whisk
broom.</p>

<p>It is absolutely essential to reach the <i>under</i> sides of the
leaves in applying insect destroyers.</p>

<p>Among the best insecticides which are non-poisonous to
human beings is Hellebore.</p>

<p>Following is a list of remedies for insects oftenest found in
gardens.</p>

<p>Eleanor looked up from the notes she had made.</p>

Frances.</p>

<p>“Feather Flop!” exclaimed Eleanor. “Do you
mean your pet rooster?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” declared Mary Frances, “he really had a
great deal to do with it, although Billy ridicules the
idea.”</p>

<p>“I can’t quite understand it myself,” Eleanor said.
“I thought chickens were very injurious to a garden.”</p>

<p>“Not Feather Flop! He has been so interested
from the very first that I myself have been amazed.
Eleanor, you should hear about the cutworms and
other insects he has eaten, and the weeds he has taken
out of the garden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary Frances grew excited in being able to praise
the rooster to someone.</p>

<p>“He made little piles of weeds at the end of each
vegetable patch, and I had to pretend to Billy that I
did the weeding, for he’d never, never have believed
that Feather Flop did the work.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it wonderful!” exclaimed Eleanor. “Do
tell me more about him!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed Mary Frances, “here comes

<p>“Hello, girls, want to see something fine?” Billy
looked in the play house window.</p>

<p>“Of course!” cried the girls at once.</p>

<p>“Come on out then—follow me.”</p>

<p>Billy led them to the vegetable garden.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Just brush a little of the earth away from that
radish,” replied Billy, pointing to one of the largest
plants.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried Mary Frances, as she pulled the
little red ball root, and held it up for admiration.</p>

<p>“Oh, Eleanor, it is ready to eat! The very first
thing from my garden. Let’s give it to Eleanor, Billy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed, no!” declared Eleanor. “I think, Mary
Frances, you should have the very first of the crop!”</p>

<p>“I know what!” exclaimed Mary Frances. “I’ll
cut it up into three pieces!”</p>

<p>“Augh, count me out!” exclaimed Billy. “I don’t
want any! Besides, I guess there are several others
nearly that size.”</p>

<p>“But no other first ones!” declared Mary Frances.
“My, if the garden weren’t to be a surprise, I’d want
to divide this with Mother and Father, too.”</p>

<p>“So would I!” exclaimed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Well, if girls aren’t silly!” Billy looked almost
disgusted. “If you want the radish, eat it up. The
garden can’t be a secret much longer anyhow, for in a
day or two you can pull a couple of bunches of radishes
and several small heads of lettuce.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it seems too good to be true!” exclaimed
Mary Frances, dancing around in joy at the thought.</p>

<p>“But,” said Eleanor, “surely your parents know
you are gardening. Anybody with eyes could see
that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” exclaimed Mary Frances, “they know we
are doing some work near the play house, but I asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
them not to try to find out anything about what we
were doing, and they haven’t come near! They want
to be surprised! I know they do!”</p>

<p>“But how did you get the money to buy the seeds
and plants?” asked Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Mother gave me permission to use some money
from my bank, and Billy loaned me some from the
money he won as a prize in school. I have to pay
that back.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t,” said Eleanor. “I wish Bob and
I had just such a garden.”</p>

<p>“You can have,” said Billy; “I hope Bob will be
able to make me a visit as soon as he has finished being
‘coached’ in his Latin!”</p>

<p>“That won’t be for some time,” replied Eleanor.
“Meanwhile, I’ll try to learn all I can about gardening,
and we’ll be ready to start in earnest next
Spring.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t that be lovely!” cried Mary Frances.
“I’m so glad you’re here to see our experiment. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
soon did you say, Billy, we could take the radishes and
lettuce to Mother?”</p>

<p>“About day after to-morrow,” answered Billy,
examining the vegetables closely again. “And a
picking of peas in about ten days.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody! I love the vegetable garden almost
as well as the flower garden,” cried Mary Frances,
“although the flowers are so interesting and are growing
beautifully. Come, let us go look to see if any are
ready to bloom,” leading the way to the front garden.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Billy; “I’m going fishing.”</p>

<p>“Good luck!” cried both the girls. “Wish you’d
take us!”</p>

<p>But Billy pretended he didn’t hear.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Feather Flop’s Temptation</span></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“QUEER,” said Feather Flop, as he stopped
crowing for a moment early the next morning,
“queer, that I can never get to see
my little Miss alone any more. How I do hate to see
company come, for then I can’t get a word with her!
Never mind, I’ll go over to the vegetable garden in
a few minutes to see how everything is getting
along. I’ll crow very loud now; she might possibly
hear and come out.”</p>

<p>He flapped his wings and swelled out his breast,
and began to crow loud and long.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>He looked at the windows of Mary Frances’ room.</p>

<p>“No sign of her yet. Well, I’ll go over to the
garden now, and I’ll work hard to help her.”</p>

<p>He walked over to the play house garden, occasionally
stopping to give an answer to a neighboring
hen or rooster.</p>

<p>“You’re earlier than usual this morning,” crowed
the rooster in the next neighbor’s yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cock-a-doodle-doo,” answered Feather Flop. “It
doesn’t take much to beat you! Good-morning,
though!” and walked on.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the vegetable garden, he fell
right to work pulling weeds from between the rows of
onions and peas.</p>

<p>When he came to the lettuce, he stopped his
work.</p>

<p>“My,” he said. “My, doesn’t that look good!
Oh, how sweet and tender that looks! I don’t believe
anybody would miss a leaf or two of the little leaves
inside those largest heads.”</p>

<p>He picked at the inside of the largest and most
beautiful head in the garden.</p>

<p>“Good!” he ejaculated. “Good! I should think so!
I wish I had more!”</p>

<p>“I hope nobody saw me,” he whispered as he
looked around. No one was in sight. “Nobody
would miss that little peck! I’ll try another head.”</p>

<p>“That’s better than the other,” he said, swallowing
the dainty morsel and blinking hard. “I’ll take a
little from each of these large heads, and nobody will
know anything about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all I’ll try now,” he decided finally. “I
don’t wonder human beings like such stuff.”</p>

<p>He fell to work again and stopped only when he
saw Mary Frances and Eleanor come out of the house
and go to the hammock. Then he ran near enough to
hear what they were saying.</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning,” Mary Frances began, “to-morrow
morning I can take in the beautiful lettuce.
Oh, Eleanor, such perfect heads. I can scarcely wait
one more day.”</p>

<p>“If we hadn’t promised to go over to Cloverdale,
we would work in the garden all day to-day, wouldn’t
we, Mary Frances?” said Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Eleanor, I believe you love a garden almost as
much as I!” declared Mary Frances. “Well, we can’t
work in the garden to-day; we must get ready for our
little journey.”</p>

<p>“But, oh—lettuce for to-morrow!” cried Eleanor,
throwing her arm around Mary Frances’ waist as they
skipped up the walk into the house.</p>

<p>Feather Flop watched them from behind the tree
where he was hiding. “Maybe I oughtn’t to have
touched it after all,” he said.</p>

next morning long before the children came for
the radishes and lettuce.</p>

<p>When he saw them coming, he ran around a corner
of the play house, where he could hear every word,
but could not be seen.</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy,” cried Mary Frances, happily, “isn’t
this just fine! Eleanor and I will pull the radishes and
you can get the lettuce.”</p>

<p>Eleanor began to help Mary Frances, and Billy
went to the lettuce bed.</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” He shouted so loud both
the girls jumped.</p>

<p>“What in the world’s the matter?” Mary Frances
dropped the radishes she had in her hand.</p>

<p>“Matter!” roared Billy. “Matter! That old
rooster of yours has eaten the hearts of the lettuce!
That’s all! Darn him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy, don’t use such language!” cried Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Frances. “Maybe he didn’t do it. Maybe it was a
cutworm or a sparrow, or—or—”</p>

<p>“Look here!” demanded Billy. “Who took that
bite?” pointing to a hole in the lettuce just the size
of Feather Flop’s beak.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Mary Frances, “I’m afraid
it was Feather Flop! Oh, how could he have done
such a thing!”</p>

<p>“That’s not the only one!” went on Billy, examining
further. “Every one of these big heads has just
such a bite taken out!”</p>

<p>“What shall we do!” exclaimed Eleanor. “What
a disappointment!”</p>

<p>“I’m ready to cry!” said Mary Frances. “I
wonder if any of it is fit to use!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Billy, “of course, you can use
some of the leaves, but the beauty of each head is
spoiled! Here, you girls take these things to the
house.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“I’m going hunting—hunting for a bird!” replied
Billy grimly.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t hurt him!” called the girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not if I can help it,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with him?” again called
Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Come help me catch him, and you’ll see. I’m
going to make a prisoner of him!” Billy just then
caught sight of Feather Flop as he half ran and half
flew across the lawn.</p>

<p>The rooster gave them a long chase, but finally
Billy caught him and tucked him under his arm.</p>

<p>Feather Flop meanwhile kept up an incessant
chatter.</p>

<p>“We know you’re not pleased, old fellow,”
said Billy as he put him into a coop and held it
down, “but you’re going to be put into a safe
place. No pleading off for you! Now, I’ve got you
fixed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you bad boy!” said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>At twilight, however, a little girl crept out with a
plate of lettuce to the old hen-coop where Feather
Flop was prisoner.</p>

<p>“Feather Flop,” Mary Frances whispered softly,
“Feather Flop!” but there was no answer.</p>

<p>She stooped down and looked into the coop. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
first she didn’t see the rooster, then she espied him
leaning up close to the farthest corner.</p>

<p>“Why, Feather Flop,” she exclaimed, “are you
ill? Why didn’t you answer?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sick,” muttered Feather Flop.</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter then, old fellow?” said
Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Are you going to let me out?” asked the rooster
sullenly.</p>

<p>“Not to-night, Feather Flop, I’m afraid. I think,
myself, you need a little punishment. Tell me, why
did you do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll not answer,” said Feather Flop. “I’m
mad!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Feather Flop!” exclaimed Mary Frances.
“Oh, Feather Flop! You did wrong, and now you’re
angry! What is the matter with you? You used to
be so nice!”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me alone,” answered the rooster.</p>

<p>“All right, then,” said Mary Frances. “All right!
I’m going away now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care! You could have saved me from
being a jail bird!” said Feather Flop, turning tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Excuse me, I don’t care to answer another word!”
he declared, putting his head under his wing.</p>

<p>Just then her mother called her, and Mary Frances
had to leave him to go into the house.</p>

<p>“Poor old Feather Flop!” murmured the little girl.
“Maybe I should have saved him from being locked
up like a real thief! I don’t believe he meant to be
so bad!”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Father and Mother’s Surprise</span></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“PERHAPS you suspected, Mother dear,”
said Mary Frances after showing the
radishes and lettuce, and telling about the
garden lessons Billy had taught her. “Perhaps you
and Father suspected we were gardening.”</p>
<div>

<img class="split" src="images/i-197b.jpg" alt="page deco" width="518" height="206" />
</div>
<p>“We had an idea that something was being done in
that line,” smiled her mother, “but we did just as you
requested. We didn’t try to find out.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that dear!” exclaimed Eleanor. “I think
Mary Frances has such wonderful experiences!”</p>

<p>“She has had a happy life,” said the mother, looking
sympathetically at Mary Frances’ little friend, for
Eleanor’s mother had died two years before.</p>

<p>Only for a few moments did the tears stand in
Eleanor’s eyes, then she said:</p>

<p>“Mary Frances has been so good about sharing her
splendid times with me. Do you remember the cooking
lessons, and the sewing lessons, and Mrs. Paper
Doll’s housekeeping lessons, girlie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re not so far past that you can’t remember,”
smiled Mary Frances’ mother, “but you girls are
growing up fast. I hope that, even when you are young
ladies, you will delight in just such lessons as you have
already had.”</p>

<p>“I feel sure I shall,” declared Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“I do, too,” said Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Play lessons,” went on the mother, “keep fun in
your hearts and ‘fun keeps one young,’ you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, these garden lessons were fun,” said Mary
Frances, “but they had a great deal of hard work
attached. Oh, Mother dear, I’ll ask you what I
meant to! May we serve the lettuce and radishes for
dinner, and not say a word to Father about them?
Then, perhaps he’ll say, ‘What fine radishes! What
tender lettuce! Where did you get them, Mother?’
Oh, wouldn’t I just love that to happen!”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that he will say it, Mary Frances!
I would, I know, for I’ve not seen any so fine this
year,” replied her mother.</p>

<p>“I have the radishes all washed and ready for the
table,” said Eleanor. “Shall I put them on?”</p>

<p>Mary Frances nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just put them in the refrigerator until nearer the
meal hour,” said her mother, “then they’ll get more
crisp!”</p>

<p>“How about this lettuce?” asked Mary Frances,
who had it well washed by this time. “Feather Flop
didn’t hurt it so much after all,” she said to herself.
“I don’t think I’ll say anything about what he did.”</p>

<p>“Put it in this glass-covered dish and place it on
the ice to make it crisp in the same way.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Here comes Father!” exclaimed Mary Frances,
and she and Eleanor ran to meet him.</p>

<p>“Dinner’s about ready, Father,” said the mother,
greeting him and nodding her head to the girls to put
their “surprise” on the table.</p>

<p>“Billy will be here in a minute,” he replied. “I
saw him as I turned in the walk. There he is, now.”</p>

<p>“Why,” he exclaimed, as he looked at the table,
“where did these beautiful little red radishes come
from? We haven’t seen such beauties this year!
And that lettuce! Who’s been sending in such a
treat?”</p>

<p>Mary Frances was delighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s our surprise!” she explained. “They are
from my own garden, Father!” and she told about the
lessons.</p>

<p>At least she tried to tell, but Billy, and Eleanor,
too, helped in telling the story.</p>

<p>“Such interesting lessons, Father!” said Mary
Frances. “My, I had no idea gardening is so wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed her father. “Billy boy, I see
it paid to send you to a practical school.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” said Eleanor, “that Bob was going to
study gardening, too.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you persuade your father to send him
away to Billy’s school this Fall?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that be splendid!” exclaimed Eleanor.
“I never thought of it. I’ll try my best!”</p>

<p>“But, Father, you and Mother both had an idea
of what we were about, hadn’t you?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“We knew ‘something was up,’ Billy,” smiled his
father, “but we didn’t know radishes and lettuce were.”</p>

<p>Everybody laughed.</p>

<p>“Now, that we’re all in the secret,” Mary Frances
declared happily, “I like it better than ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Father can give us a lot of information I don’t
know a bit about,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“I believe Mother knows a lot she’s not telling,”
said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Father, won’t you give us some lessons on the
wild flowers?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“That would be delightful,” his mother said. “We
could all share in such lessons. For instance, some
day soon we could all take a walk in the woods.”</p>

<p>“Won’t that be a picnic!” Billy was enthusiastic.
“When shall we go? Can’t you make a holiday of
it, Father? Let us take our lunch.”</p>

<p>“If it suits all parties, we’ll go day after to-morrow,”
said his father.</p>

<p>“It just suits me!” declared Billy.</p>

<p>“It just suits me!” echoed Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“It just suits me!” said Eleanor.</p>

<p>“How about you, Mother?” asked the father.</p>

<p>“It will charm me to accept the invitation,”
smiled the mother.</p>

<p>“Don’t you girls oversleep!” warned Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy, we’re not the sleepy-heads!” laughed
Mary Frances, shaking her finger at Billy.</p>

said Mary Frances, when she took his breakfast
to the coop next morning, “unless
you speak to me, I am not coming out again! I’m
going to get Billy to bring you your food,” and she
turned away.</p>

<p>Feather Flop stuck his head between the slats of
the coop, and a tear rolled out of each eye.</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t go away,” he begged. “I’m so
awfully ashamed of myself I don’t know what to say.
That’s the reason I didn’t answer.”</p>

<p>“You poor dear old Feather Flop,” cried Mary
Frances, opening the slats. “You poor old fellow!”</p>

“that I’d gladly have you chop my head off and make

</div>
<p>“Oh, Feather Flop, don’t feel quite so bad as that,”
exclaimed Mary Frances. “I forgive you, my friend.”</p>

<p>For the first time, Feather Flop looked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you?” he asked. “Please tell me again.”</p>

<p>“I forgive you, Feather Flop,” repeated Mary
Frances, gathering him up in her arms. “The lettuce
wasn’t so badly hurt, after all.”</p>

<p>“My, I’m so thankful,” said Feather Flop, “though
I don’t see how you can forgive me. Are you certain
that you do?”</p>

<p>“Very certain!” smiled Mary Frances. “As certain
as I am that you’ll never do such a thing
again!”</p>

<p>“Never again!” solemnly declared Feather Flop,
holding up one claw. “Never again!”</p>

<p>“Well, now, eat your breakfast,” said Mary
Frances, putting him down and gently stroking his
beautiful feathers.</p>

<p>“I—haven’t—eaten—a—beakful,” said Feather
Flop between hungry pecks, “since—I—was—put—in—prison,—so—you—can—imagine—how—awfully—hungry—I—am.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I can,” laughed Mary Frances, delighted
to see him his own self again.</p>

<p>“Does being forgiven always make a person feel
hungry?” asked Feather Flop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, being unforgiven makes a person feel very
unhungry,” said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“A strange thing about me, I guess,” said Feather
Flop, “is, that after I’ve eaten a full meal, I’m not
hungry.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” laughed Mary Frances. “Nobody
ever is.”</p>

<p>“It’s very sad, though,” declared the rooster.</p>

<p>“Why,” began Mary Frances, “I don’t see anything
sad about that.”</p>

<p>“It’s sad, because it’s so much fun to be hungry
and eat. I’d like to eat every minute myself—when
I’m forgiven.”</p>

<p>“You do pretty well, Feather Flop,” said Mary
Frances. “I wouldn’t complain. It’s far worse to be
hungry and not to be able to get food.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” said Feather Flop.</p>

<p>“What’s the next lesson?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Next lesson?” echoed Mary Frances. “Oh,
about roses. Isn’t that a nice one?”</p>

<p>“Call on me for anything I can do,” said Feather
Flop. “I’d starve a year and a half before I’d touch
anything good in the garden again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, my friend,” said Mary Frances.
“Thank you! I’ll call upon you, never fear. I must
go now, though.”</p>

<p>“Shake hands?” asked Feather Flop, holding out
his claw. “Just to show real forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mary Frances, taking his claw in
her hand and shaking it in a most serious fashion.</p>

<p>As much as she wanted to, she did not smile.</p>

Gardener explained to us that for this
reason, rose growing has become a specialty among
professional floriculturists.”</p>

<p>“Mercy, Billy,” interrupted Mary Frances, “please
explain those last two long words.”</p>

<p>“‘Professional floriculturists,’” explained Billy, “are
men who raise flowers as a profession or business.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Eleanor.</p>

<p>The children were in the rose arbor, where the
girls had begged him to give them a lesson on roses.</p>

<p>“Because,” Eleanor had said, “roses are my favorite
flowers.”</p>

<p>“Mine, too, except violets,” Mary Frances had added.</p>

<p>“The result of this specializing,” resumed Billy,
“is that there are many beautiful new kinds of roses
constantly being introduced into our country, for
while a good many new roses have been produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
here, the most have been produced by growers across
the ocean, in Ireland and France.”</p>

<p>“I never knew that,” exclaimed Eleanor. “I
thought that roses were—just roses.”</p>

<p>“So did I!” declared Mary Frances. Then suddenly,
“Oh, here comes mother! Don’t stop talking,
Billy! Mother will love to hear!”</p>

certainly appreciate hearing what you learned from
your teachers about them.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right, Mother,” said Billy, “but I’ll
stick more closely to my notes than I generally do,
since we are honored by your presence.”</p>

Billy opened his note book.</p>

<p>A flower garden would be lacking in interest and beauty,
indeed, without the Queen of Flowers, the rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>No matter how small the garden space, some roses may be
grown, and their loveliness and perfume will well repay the work
of caring for them.</p>

<p>There were no such beautiful roses in your grandmothers’
gardens as you may grow to-day, for more beautiful and more
perfect roses come into existence every year.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have heard of “Damask,” and “Cabbage,”
and “China” roses; old-fashioned sounding names they are,
very familiar to the ears of your grandparents.</p>

<p>They were the great-great-grandparents of the hardier and
lovelier roses of to-day, the “Hybrid Perpetuals,” and “Hybrid
Teas.”</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">How New Roses Came About</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some few of the new roses were accidents, so called because
good Mrs. Bee carried some strange rose pollen to the pistil of
one or more of the old-fashioned roses, and the new rose seed-babies
took on a new nature. When the little plants from the
new rose seed-baby bloomed, rose lovers were delighted with the
more perfect loveliness of the new flower.</p>

<p>They carefully saved the new plant, and tenderly cared
for it. When it was old enough and strong enough, they took
“cuttings” from its shoots, and grew more plants like it.</p>

<p>Now, rose lovers after noticing what good Mrs. Bee had
done by accident, thought, “I wonder if a person could not dust
the pollen from a very different rose on the pistil of some particular
rose.” This was tried, and to-day we have such wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
improvements on the old-fashioned roses that no other flower
gives quite the pleasure to garden lovers as the rose.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">How Roses are Propagated</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No, the seeds of the new varieties would probably not bring
plants like themselves. More likely they would resemble closely
their parents or grandparents. Besides, it takes a long time to
raise a plant from a rose seed.</p>

<p>So the safest and surest way to propagate, or grow more
of, the new varieties is by:</p>


<ul class="plants2"><li>(<i>a</i>) Cuttings, or</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Budding.</li></ul></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cuttings</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Cuttings</i> are “slips” cut from the plant, which if kept in
damp sand will take root.</p>

<p>New geranium plants are usually procured in this way.
In fact, the old plant is often cut entirely up into sections and each
section is planted in an earthen pot. They are kept damp, and
soon throw out roots. The new plants of the geranium will bloom
much better than the old one, especially in winter, in the house.</p>

<p>Many roses will readily grow out-of-doors from cuttings.
Among these are the Rambler roses, the Dorothy Perkins being
one of the easiest to raise. Among the Hybrid Tea roses, the
La France grows readily from cuttings.</p>

<p>Cuttings, however, do best if raised under glass, in a greenhouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Each little cutting may have its own greenhouse. This is
arranged by—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Growing Rose Cuttings Under Glass Jars</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At any time in warm weather some cuttings will take root
under an inverted jar. The best time to experiment, however,
is in the Spring or in August.</p>

<p>The tip cut from a strong growing shoot, or cane, does best.
It should have at least three joints, one of which is near the base.
After all the leaves but one, and the tip are cut off, the “slip”
is placed in damp sandy soil up to <i>one-third</i> of its length, and
covered over with an inverted quart jar. The glass jar is the
little cutting’s own hot-house where it will have wonderfully
good conditions for “taking root.”</p>

<p>Do not lift the jar for many a day, but keep the soil well
watered.</p>

<p>After a number of weeks, most likely you will notice new
leaves putting forth, and will know that the cutting has become
a little plant with its own roots. Let it grow under the jar until
the tip reaches the glass; then uncover.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to make cuttings especially for the purpose,
for rose<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> bushes have been raised from the stem of a blooming
rose after the blossom has faded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Cuttings are inexpensive, and the method is an easy one
for obtaining a large number of plants; but there is a better and
quicker and more certain way for professional rose growers.</p>

<p>This is by—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Budding</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In order to find what is meant by budding, you must understand
that the “bud” referred to means the little green “eye”
on the stem of the plant where a branch will grow.</p>

<p>This “eye” is cut off with a sharp knife, and slipped under
the bark of some wild rose plant, called the “stock.”</p>

<p>The advantage of budding is that the growth is rapid and
commences with the strong roots of the wild plant.</p>

<p>If you buy rose plants from the dealer, they will probably
be budded plants. Now, watch for—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">“Suckers”</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You see, in budding, after the “bud” or “eye” has begun
to put forth leaves, all the branches of the wild rose plant are
cut away, and only the new bud allowed to grow. Sometimes the
<i>wild rose stock</i> or root will send out a shoot after the new rose
bush is planted. If this is allowed to grow, it will use all the
food sent up by the roots, and the new budded growth will die
out, unless the <i>wild rose shoot is cut off close</i>.</p>

<p>“Suckers” are very easily discerned. They are full of
prickles, are light green in color, and usually have seven leaves.
Cultivated rose bushes with few exceptions have five leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>You do not want to find any of your lovely rose bushes
killed in this way—so watch out for “suckers!”</p></div>

<p>Billy looked up from his note book, “I haven’t
read exactly as I have taken these notes,” he said;
“I’ve made the lesson shorter. Do you wish me
to go on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, please do!” cried the girls.</p>

<p>“Yes, Son,” said his mother, “that is, if you are
not too tired. I imagine we are coming to that interesting
point where we will learn what roses were
recommended to you for planting.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Classes of Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If we should go back many years, and give the names of
the old roses and follow their history until the present time, you
could scarcely remember their names.</p>

<p>Already you have heard of “Damask,” “China,” and “Cabbage”
roses, and have been told that they were among the grandparents
of the roses of to-day.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Homes of Certain Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Perhaps it would interest you to know that Damask roses
were found around Damascus, in Syria, and taken to Europe
in about the year 1573; that the “Cabbage”, or “Provence”,
rose is supposed to have been known to the Romans, and later
was grown extensively in Provence, in the South of France;
that the “China” rose was brought to Europe sometime in the
eighteenth century from China, where it is a native or “wild”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
rose; that the beautiful, fragrant and delicate Tea rose was
brought from China to England about 1815.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">About Hybrid Perpetual Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not necessary to tell what particular old roses became
the great-grandparents of our present roses. Indeed, it would be
a difficult matter, for commercial rose growers have guarded
well the secret of just what roses they used to produce the new
ones.</p>

<p>The term given to a new flower is <i>hybrid</i>, which means a
<i>mixture</i>. When, about the year 1825, a new class of roses, called
the Hybrid Perpetual, was brought into existence, everybody was
glad, because these new hybrids bloomed longer than any of their
parents; were of good strong growth; and were perfectly <i>hardy</i>.</p>

<p>Perfectly hardy <i>means that they would live out-of-doors over
severe winter weather</i>.</p>

<p>Hybrid Perpetual roses are among our most prized roses of
to-day for these same reasons; but we now have a still more
valuable class of hybrids, with a longer season of bloom, which
were derived from—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Perhaps the loveliest of all roses are the Tea roses, because
of their beauty and enchanting fragrance; but they are delicate.
Very few Tea rose bushes can live out-of-doors over <i>cold</i> weather.
Not only are Tea roses most beautiful and fragrant, but they
<i>bloom almost continuously</i> during the entire season.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">About Hybrid Tea Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So, as I have said, garden lovers who lived where the winters
were severely cold and bring snow, could not have the lovely Tea
roses in their gardens.</p>

<p>You can imagine their delight when another new class of
roses appeared—roses which bloom freely like the Tea roses,
and have much of their fragrance, yet are hardy and can live out-of-doors
in winter weather, except in the “way north country.”</p>

<p>The name of this wonderful new class of roses is Hybrid
Tea; which means, as you already know, that the new roses are
the result of a mixture of Tea roses with others.</p>

<p>Hybrid Tea roses are, in fact, a mixture of Tea roses with
Hybrid Perpetuals.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">What Roses to Plant</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For blooms for cut flowers, you will plant many Hybrid
Tea roses, and some few Hybrid Perpetuals; for, while Hybrid
Perpetuals bloom plentifully only in June, and have a few blooms
in the Autumn, they are so large and magnificent that no one
wishes to do without the following:</p>



<div class="center">

June, and a few times
in Summer; quite well
in the Fall. They are
very hardy. Prune after
June blooming to get Autumn blooms.</p></td>

<p class="p2">Deep crimson maroon.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</div>


<p>There are several other very desirable Hybrid Perpetual
roses, but the name of one only of each color has been listed,
because one has so much more pleasure in cutting a half dozen
buds of the same color and form than a mixture of different
kinds.</p>

<p>Even if one has space for many rose bushes, there is a great
deal more satisfaction in having two or more bushes of the same
variety than many different kinds, for a bouquet of the same
kind of flowers is so much more beautiful than an assortment.</p>

<p>Perhaps you thought that the words Hybrid Perpetual meant
continuous blooming. Many a grown person has made this
mistake in looking over the seedsmen’s catalogs. Probably the
name Perpetual refers to the fact that the plant lives over
from year to year and has such a long life. In England,
however, Hybrid Perpetuals bloom for a much longer time
than in our country, for the climate is better suited to
roses.</p>

<p>Of the many, many beautiful Hybrid Tea roses, you will
wish red, white, pink, and yellow; and you will be pleased if
you grow some of the following:</p>

<p>In looking over these lists, perhaps you are wondering why
you do not find the name of the rose, American Beauty, so dear
to American hearts. The American Beauty rose is not hardy,
and is grown under glass, and as we are considering only out-of-door
roses, it is not listed.</p>

<p>If you happen to live in the warm climate of the South or
in California, you can have the luxury of growing the more tender
roses, and I am giving you a list of some of the best Tea roses.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to raise them if you live where there is much

<h3><span class="smcap">Wichuraiana Roses</span> (<span class="smcap">Evergreen or Memorial Roses</span>)</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These roses will live in our coldest climate.</p>

<p>The first were brought from Japan in 1892. The Wichuraiana
roses are highly valued where the winters are severe or
where the plant cannot receive special care, as in a cemetery.
(For this reason they have been called “Memorial.”) Once
planted, they seem to care for themselves. They trail along the
ground, or over rocks, and often climb over any support.</p>

<p>Do not plant them in the rose garden where you need space
to grow bushes for blooms which are lovely for cutting.</p>

<p>Wichuraiana roses bloom in June and July and sometimes
later. Insects do not trouble the beautiful shiny foliage, which
stays green nearly all winter.</p>

<p>The single roses, if not cut, become red berries in the Autumn.
“<i>Wichuraiana</i>” is the catalog name of the single variety.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rugosa Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sometimes Rugosa Roses have been called, “Ironclad,”
because of their thick leathery foliage, which is seldom, if ever,
troubled with insects; and because of their wonderful hardiness
and ability to live under trying conditions.</p>

<p>They bloom early, in large flowers, some of which resemble
large single wild roses; others resemble large “double wild roses,”
if you can imagine such roses. Many make the Autumn gay
with their brilliant red seed berries.</p>

<p>Do not make the mistake of planting Rugosa among the
rose bushes you are growing for cut flowers.</p>

<p>They are used where heavy growth is needed; as among
shrubbery or for a hedge. A single plant looks well on a lawn
or at a corner of a house. The Rugosa roses grow from four to
six feet tall.</p>

<p>“Just listen!” exclaimed Mary Frances, “Billy,
don’t you feel repaid for giving us the lesson? What
comes next?”</p>

<p>“Next comes—let me see,” replied Billy. “Oh,
yes, it’s about planting and caring for roses, I remember.”</p>

<p>“When will you give us that?” asked Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Does it tell about ‘Tree Roses?’” asked Mary
Frances eagerly before Billy could answer Eleanor.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you <i>now</i>,” he said, “about—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tree Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tree Roses are Hybrid Perpetual or Hybrid Tea or other
roses, budded or grafted high up on strong stock, or wild growth,
and cut or pruned to the form of trees.</p>

<p>They are very attractive in a formal or “set out” garden,
or for edging walks, but such great care must be taken to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
them warm during cold weather that it is best not to try them
except in places where there is little snow in winter.</p>

<p>For winter bed covers, place boards around the plant and
fill with earth.</p></div>

<p>“Miss Gardener said,” went on Billy, “that
English and Irish rose growers are constantly sending
new varieties of roses over to Americans, but the new
roses have to be tested in our climate before we can
be certain if they will do well here. That’s all the
lesson for to-day,” he declared. “Come to-morrow
morning for the next lesson—that is, if you want to.
The day after, you know, we go on the Wild Flower
Picnic.”</p>

<p>Billy was perched in the fork of an

<h3><span class="smcap">How to Plant Roses</span></h3>

<p>Before you can make a list of the roses you wish to order,
you must understand something about the state in which they
will be when received, how far apart they may be planted, and—</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Where to Make Beds for Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Roses like warmth and air. They love to drink, but they
do not like wet feet.</p>

<p>Knowing these things, you will select for your rose bed an
airy, sunny place on the south side of a building or wall, if possible,
where the ground is not so low that it will hold moisture
long.</p>

<p>Having decided what is the best place you can offer your
roses, you will want to know—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">How to Make Beds for Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Do not buy too many plants for the space. Do not
make the bed over five feet wide. If wider, you will tread on the
soil and make it heavy.</p>

<p>2. Remember, roses are usually planted twenty-one inches
apart. (Do not plant Wichuraiana or Rugosa roses in the bed.)</p>

<p>Alternate the plants, as shown in the following diagram:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="garden layout">
<tr><td align="center">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (2)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)<br />
(5)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)<br />
(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="3"><p>This saves garden space, and gives room for the roots.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</div>




<p>3. To be beautiful, roses must have plenty of good food.
So <i>dig deep;</i> eighteen inches is a good depth. Fill this space with
a mixture of soil and well-rotted stable manure. It is best not
to let the roots of the roses touch the manure. Sprinkle a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
little soil over the manure before putting the plant into its
place. If the ground is very damp, dig deeper than two
feet and throw in a basket of stones, through which the water
will drain.</p>

<p>4. Roses are received from the dealer either growing in pots,
or dormant (dry), or with little balls of earth around the roots
wrapped in damp moss.</p>

<p>The young inexperienced gardener will do best with the
potted plants, but if the plants are dry and dormant (dormant
means <i>sleeping</i>), it is well to soak the roots before planting.
Never expose damp roots to the air. Keep in water or damp
earth until planted.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">How Deep to Plant Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Unless grown in pots, spread out the roots and pack the
earth firmly about them, putting the plant deep enough to bring
earth three inches over the “bud” or graft.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Best Time to Plant Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">depends on where you live.</p>

<p>In general, Spring is the best time, but in the South and on
the Pacific coast, Autumn is best.</p>

<p>Some of the <i>hardiest</i> sorts will grow well, when set out in the
Fall, even in places where the winters are severe.</p>

<p>Now, the bushes are planted, and we will think about—</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Caring for Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The chief cares for roses are:</p>

<p>1. Cultivating, or stirring the soil.</p>

<p>2. Feeding.</p>

<p>3. Destroying insect enemies.</p>

<p>4. Pruning.</p>

<p>You already understand the importance of cultivating and
the importance of feeding the plants.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fertilizers</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two of the best foods for roses and easiest to use, are bone
dust and dried sheep manure, which you can buy at the seed
store. These you may dig into the soil as you cultivate, being
sure not to let the fertilizers directly touch the roots.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Enemies of Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Rose Bugs.</p>

<p>2. Aphids.</p>

<p>3. Rusts and Mildews.</p>

<p>4. Borers and other chewing insects.</p>

<p>There are several different kinds of beetles, called rose bugs,
which come up out of the ground where they have spent the
winter, just at the time of the most abundant and beautiful
blooming.</p>

<p>In the Middle Atlantic States they stay in a place about
two weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The best way to rid a plant of these enemies of roses which
“eat them alive,” is to hand-pick them, throwing them into a
can of kerosene.</p>

<p>There is a patent preparation which is good. Write your
dealer for information as to this.</p>

<p>Treat for other insects as you have already learned.</p>

<p>If your parents think you may be trusted to handle a poison,
spray in the early Spring with “Bordeaux Arsenate of Lead”
to prevent mildew and rust. In summer, use Flowers of
Sulphur.</p>

<p>Now, as to—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pruning Roses</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Prune rose bushes in the early Spring, just when the plants
<i>begin</i> to show green, which means that their sap is beginning to
flow. Use pruning for cutting the stems back.</p>

<p>Remember these principal rules:</p>

<p>1. Hybrid Perpetual Roses should be cut back about two
feet from the ground.</p>

<p>2. Cut back Hybrid Tea Roses more sparingly, that is, farther
from the ground than Hybrid Perpetuals.</p>

<p>3. Cut back Tea Roses only a short distance.</p>

<p>4. Cut only the dead wood from the other kinds.</p>

<p>Pruning cuts off the ends of the branches and causes the
plant to throw out strong joints from the eyes along the canes,
which will bear flowers.</p></div>

<p>“My,” exclaimed Mary Frances, as Billy closed
his book suddenly and jumped to the ground. “Is
that all about roses?”</p>

<p>“No, dear,” answered her mother. “No, that is
just a ‘first beginning,’ as you used to say when you
were little.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of insect enemies, I see the wicked rose
bugs have eaten into the hearts of the most beautiful
roses we own,” went on her mother.</p>

<p>“Come,” cried Mary Frances, “let’s go see if
we can find them—and drown them in kerosene.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m afraid of them!” shuddered Eleanor.</p>

<p>Mary Frances laughed. “They won’t hurt you!”
she said, running ahead. “I bet I can catch the
first hundred!”</p>

<p>“Be careful where you step!” called Billy suddenly;
but it was too late, for with a cry of pain,
his mother fell upon the thick undergrowth.</p>

<p>Billy and his father came running.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Mary Frances, “oh, dear! I ought
to have told mother. I remember tripping over
the vines here. Are you much hurt, Mother
dear?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” she replied, but as she made an
effort to move, she sank back with a little sigh.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a bad sprain, dear,” said the father,
examining her ankle, “but you ought not walk another
step.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the poor children will be so disappointed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s just like mother!” exclaimed Mary
Frances. “Never to think of herself first!”</p>

<p>“I know what you and I can do, Father,” said
Billy. “Let’s make a ‘sedan chair,’ and carry mother
home.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea, Son—we’ll leave the girls
and the lunch; and if the doctor says she may come,
I’ll drive mother out late in the afternoon after she
has rested.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, let us go with you!” cried Eleanor and
Mary Frances together.</p>

<p>“It will make me so much happier, girls,” said
the mother, “if you will stay and try to enjoy yourselves.
Billy will be back soon, and maybe you can
have a bunch of wild flowers ready to take home
when you come this afternoon. I’m not hurt seriously,
but I think a hot-water bath and bandage for this
ankle will prevent further trouble.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mother dear,” said Mary Frances,
kissing her. “If it will make you happier, we’ll stay.”</p>

<p>“I’d eat lunch right over there,” suggested Billy,
pointing out a lovely green spot near a spring.</p>

<p>“Trust Billy to think of pleasant ‘eats,’” laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Mary Frances, as Eleanor and she picked up the
lunch baskets, and Billy and his father started off
with the mother comfortably seated on the “sedan
chair” which they made with their hands.</p>

<p>“We’ll wait for you, Billy,” called Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Better not,” said Billy, “because I may be late—I
may stay to dinner at home.”</p>

<p>“We’ll wait a while, any how,” called Mary
Frances. “Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” called everybody.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The girls felt quite lonely and sad as the other
three disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” sobbed Mary Frances, “I just pretended
to be cheerful because I knew how sorry
mother was to disappoint us.”</p>

<p>“My, but you were brave,” replied Eleanor.
“Indeed, I felt just like crying, but when I saw
how you were behaving, it made me feel ashamed.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mary Frances, drying her eyes, “let’s
set the table—Billy will be back sooner or later, and
I don’t want him to see I’ve been crying!”</p>

<p>So they spread their lunch cloth and paper plates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we only had some flowers for a centerpiece!”
exclaimed Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Let’s go gather some!” suggested Eleanor.</p>

<p>“All right!” Mary Frances sprang up.</p>

<p>“What can we put them in?” asked Eleanor
practically.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know!” cried Mary Frances running to
one of the lunch baskets. “Let’s drink this milk,
and use the bottle for a holder.”</p>

<p>“Lovely!” said Eleanor. “My, I didn’t know I
was hungry!”</p>

<p>“Neither did I—let’s take a sandwich and start.”</p>

<p>Mary Frances led the way. “I’ve often walked
through this path,” she said, “and I’ve always found
some flowers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, what was that?” cried Eleanor suddenly.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” answered Mary Frances, “or
maybe a bird flying about among the leaves.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a bird!” declared Eleanor. “It’s not a
bird!” pointing down among the whirling leaves.
“Hush! Do look carefully, Mary Frances, and
listen!”</p>

<p>Although the voice was very thin and piping,
they heard every word distinctly. “That’s not a

<p>“What?” again asked the little voice.</p>

<p>“Crazy,” replied Mary Frances, laughing softly.
“But we’re not crazy. We dearly love daisies, and
wild carrot, and buttercup and—well, yes, we love

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad, because we can be friends.”</p>

<p>At that the leaves began to whirl and dance
furiously, and out of the midst of them leaped a little
fellow not anything like as large as Mary Marie, Mary
Frances’ doll.</p>

<p>He was dressed in forest brown from the tip of
his pointed cap to the toe of his pointed boot. His
coat and tiny knickerbocker breeches were made of
green leaves. Even his hair and beard were yellowish-green
as though made of very fine grass. For buckles
on his shoes he wore tiny dew drops which glistened
like diamonds. The buttons on his coat were of the
same. At the end of his peaked cap dangled a tiny
wild fringed gentian.</p>

<p>“Flower lovers are always friends,” said he,
bowing. “Young ladies, it gives me much pleasure
to introduce myself. I am Jack-in-the-Pulpit!”</p>

<p>Mary Frances wanted to ask him how he happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to be out of the pulpit, but she suddenly thought
he might not like the question, so she said:</p>

<p>“Why, how do you do, Mr. Jack? We are
pleased to know you;” and she and Eleanor both
smiled.</p>

<p>The little fellow was delighted.</p>

<p>“You really are glad—that I can see. There are
lots of human people who come into the woods who
never listen or look when we call.”</p>

<p>“Why,” asked Eleanor looking round, “are there
more of you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my, yes,” nodded the little fellow. “Lots
and lots more, only the others are very busy
getting flowers ready for next Autumn and Spring—that
is, all but one. Her name is Bouncing
Bet.”</p>

<p>At that, the leaves began to bounce and to whirl
again, and out of their midst sprang a tiny little lady.
She was so beautiful that both the girls exclaimed,
“Oh, isn’t she lovely!”</p>

<p>She certainly was lovely, in a gown of queen’s
lace over wild rose petals. On her feet were tiny
lady slippers; on her head a lovely violet. Her hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
was of yellow-white thistle-down. When she spoke,
her voice sounded like a laughing bell.</p>

<p>“So you’ve found them at last, Jack,” she laughed.
“You’ve found human beings who can hear us and
can see us. Let’s tell what we can do for them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the little fellow in green, taking
Bouncing Bet’s hand and speaking to the girls.
“Please be seated.”</p>

<p>As the girls sat down on the grassy slope, Jack
began to speak:</p>

<p>“We know you are wondering whether we are
really the flowers, ‘Jack-in-the-Pulpit’ and ‘Bouncing
Bet.’ No, we are the fairies of those flowers. Every
kind of flower has its fairy. They try to talk with
the human beings they see, but very few can hear
them or see them. Now, that you can see us and
hear us, we would like to take you with us into Fairy
Flower Land——”</p>

<p>“And tell you all we can in one short afternoon
about wild flowers,” finished Bouncing Bet. “Jack,
lead the way.”</p>

<p>Mary Frances and Eleanor were surprised that
they had to hurry to keep up to the tiny little

<p>At length they came to a high hedge.</p>

<p>“Touch me with your hand,” said Bet to Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Now, when I say ‘three,’ all jump,” commanded
Jack.</p>

<p>“One, two, three!” Over the top of hedge they
went as though they had wings, and found themselves
in the midst of a wonderful garden.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Mary Frances, “I never, never saw
so many wild flowers blooming at once.”</p>

<p>“This is a fairy garden,” answered Bouncing Bet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
“and the fairies keep it for just such friends as you,
who are anxious to learn about wild flowers.”</p>

<p>“But we can tell you only the shortest flower
stories to-day.” Jack caught up the conversation.
“Just take a seat please, and I’ll begin.”</p>

<p>The girls sat on a pretty rustic bench under a
tree, and Jack and Bet leaped upon a branch in
front of them. Then Jack began:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">“Good and Bad Weeds”</span></h3>

<p>“Of course you know that all the flowers cultivated
in your gardens have come from wild flowers.</p>

<p>“Through years of care, the wild flowers have
improved so that it would be almost impossible to
trace each of the plants in your gardens to the wild
flowers from which it was started.</p>

<p>“There are many hundreds of wild flowers, but
none more beautiful than those growing in America.
There are many different kinds which were growing
here when America was discovered, but the seeds of
many more were carried over from Europe in grain
for the colonists.</p>

<p>“Some of the wild things are most helpful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
human beings; such as mint, and dock, and dear old
dandelions, and other ‘weeds’ which may be eaten.
From ‘weeds’ also come some of the most wonderful
of<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>medicines. Perhaps you have tested the medicinal
effects of mustard, catnip, and boneset.”</p>

<p>“I tried catnip on our Jubey,” said Mary Frances.
“It did her lots of good.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had mustard plasters, and mustard baths,
and boneset tea when I’ve been ill with chills,”
Eleanor added.</p>

<p>“Just so! just so!” nodded Jack-in-the-Pulpit;
“so you see, many ‘weeds’ are not useless plants, but
are very valuable. The Indians knew that.”</p>

<p>“My, I hadn’t any idea weeds were valuable,”
said Eleanor.</p>

<p>“I always knew about mint and catnip,” Mary
Frances replied, “but I didn’t know other weeds were
of so much help.”</p>

<p>“Of course there are many weeds which seem of
no value at all. They steal the food of valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
plants and choke them out.” Jack went on. “For
instance, there’s corn cockle, the seeds of which are
poisonous. It loves to grow among the corn and
wheat, and troubles the farmers terribly.”</p>

<p>“I think the flowers are quite pretty,” Mary
Frances ventured to say.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know them when you see them?” asked
Jack. “That’s good, because we can go on with
our story faster if you know some of the wild flowers.
You would like to gather some out of our fairy garden,
wouldn’t you? Well, you may take some of
all that are in bloom at this time of year, after we
finish telling you what we so much want you to learn
about our dear flowers.”</p>

<p>“Now, it is Bet’s turn,” he went on, turning
toward the dainty little fairy, who began to bounce
happily up and down on the branch of the tree.</p>

<p>The girls were delighted with her dancing. At
length she stopped and began to talk in her musical
voice.</p>

<p>“I am going to talk a little about the flowers,”
she said, “and shall mention only the ones known
by most people, because we have such a short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
for your lesson. I shall just mention them, and if
you do not know them, please interrupt me, and
Jack and I will take you through the garden to show
them to you. Do you know the—</p>

<p>This charming gold and white, wheel-shaped

<p>Almost everywhere this tall rod, bearing yellow
flowers, which resemble huge buttercups, may be
seen from June to November. Its velvety leaves,
which grow in rosettes on the ground, are soft to
the touch, but if sheep or cows try to eat them,
the down upon them becomes splinters in the
tongues of the animals. That is one reason it
grows so widely—the down saves the leaves from
harm. This same down is sometimes used by humming
birds to line their tiny nests, which are no
larger than a large thimble, yet hold two
humming-bird babies.</p>
<p>The seeds of the great Mullein are eaten by
goldfinches, or they would scatter yet more
abundantly.</p>
<p>The great Mullein is a native of Europe.</p>

<p>Just as Bet finished speaking about the milk-weed,
there sounded a silvery clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>One! Two! Three! it chimed.</p>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed Jack. “Oh, can it be possible
that it is three o’clock! Bet, you must stop talking
and give me a chance!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” sighed Eleanor. “Oh, must she stop
talking? I am so anxious to learn more about the
wild flowers.”</p>

<p>“Do you know all I’ve told about, when you see
them?” asked Bouncing Bet.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Eleanor. “Do you, Mary Frances?”</p>

<p>“Not all,” Mary Frances shook her head.</p>

<p>“Come then,” cried Jack and Bet, jumping from
the tree. “Come,” and they led them among the
flowers, and pointed out to them besides the ones
mentioned: Wake Robins, Trailing Arbutus, Lupines,
Forget-Me-Nots, Columbines, Heather, Laurel, California
Poppies, and hundreds of other wild flowers
which were in bloom in the outside meadows and fields
and woods.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry we haven’t time to tell you the
story of each one,” said Jack. “Some time next
year, please come again and we’ll tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“We could come to-morrow, couldn’t we, Mary
Frances?” Eleanor ventured, but Jack answered:</p>

<p>“No, not to-morrow. Only once a year can flower
fairies talk with human beings. It must be to-day.
So now, just as quickly as possible, I am going to tell
you something about how plants are related to each
other, but please be more comfortable. Do take a
seat in the grape-vine swing.”</p>

<p>Then the girls noticed a hammock nearby, formed
by the interlacing of growing grape vines.</p>

<p>It was wonderfully comfortable, and they leaned
back contentedly as Jack took his place in a little
green lily-shaped flower growing close by, and Bouncing
Bet pranced around on the lawn near him.</p>

<p>“Jack’s in his pulpit now,” she said. “Hear
him speak.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“YOUNG ladies,” began Jack-in-the-Pulpit,
“Bouncing Bet and I have arranged a
little play for you. It’s to be this way:
after finishing a few introductory remarks, I will
call the names of various flower families. Bet has
been around to see certain members of each family,
and although they are very busy, they have promised
to come when she calls—that is, the fairy of
each flower or plant that she calls will come to this
grassy slope which is to be the stage for our play.”</p>

</div>
<p>“How perfectly lovely!” cried the girls.</p>

<p>“But they will have little time to talk,” warned
Jack. “So,” he went on, “let me tell you a few facts
about—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plant Families</span></h3>

<p>“It may surprise you to learn that certain plants
belong to certain plant families.</p>

<p>“You know that certain animals belong to certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
animal families and can easily recognize that gentle
Pussy Cat is a near relative of fierce Mr. and Mrs.
Tiger, and of Mr. and Mrs. Lion, and of Mr. and
Mrs. Panther and all the young panthers, and lions
and tigers. They all have some similarity: they all
have pointed teeth, and sharp claws, and can lap liquid
food with their tongues. They all tread with light,
soft-padded toes. There are other members of the
Cat Family of which you can think. Even though
Mrs. Puss is of near relation, she’s mightily afraid of
her big relatives.</p>

<p>“Now, I wonder if you know that faithful Mr.
Dog is own cousin to terrible Mr. and Mrs. Wolf.
Indeed, I may be mistaken, perhaps he is their own
brother, they are so much alike in some ways.</p>

<p>“Just as animals belong to certain families so
do plants. They resemble each other in certain
points which you may not notice at first, but which
you would readily see if pointed out to you.”</p>

<p>Jack drew quite a long breath.</p>

<p>“Now we are ready for the play, Bet,” he announced,
and Bet bounced down to the grass-carpet
stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Said Jack, “The first plant family called upon
will be the Rose family.”</p>

<p>Bouncing Bet blew a long musical whistle by using
two fingers at her tiny mouth, and out from some
shrubbery stepped a dainty little lady dressed in
pink rose petals.</p>

<p>“My name is Rose,” she said, smiling and throwing
the girls a kiss; “and I’ll introduce some of my
cousins in the—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rose Family</span></h3>

<p>“<i>Cherry</i>,” she called. Out stepped a red ripe
cherry with a white cap trimmed with green leaves.
Of course, the legs were very tiny, nearly like pins.
Cherry smiled and bowed and took a place beside
Rose.</p>

<p>“<i>Peach</i>,” Rose called, and out stepped a beautiful
peach, with a pink cap, trimmed with green leaves.</p>

<p>“<i>Strawberry</i>,” called Rose, and surely enough, out
came a red ripe strawberry with a white cap trimmed
with green leaves.</p>

<p>“<i>Blackberry</i>,” called the little Rose lady once
more, and before the word left her mouth, a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
blackberry came tumbling in, on his head a white
cap, trimmed with green.</p>

<p>“Oh, pardon me,” said Blackberry, picking himself
up. “I was afraid I’d be late.”</p>

<p>Rose smiled and motioned the blackberry into
place beside the strawberry.</p>

<p>Once again Rose called a name.</p>

<p>“<i>Apple</i>,” she called, and roly-poly, “head-over-tin-cups,”
came a round rosy-cheeked apple into their
midst.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” puffed Apple. “Please excuse my
manners, Cousin Rose, but I am so fat that hurrying
gets me all out of breath,” and he fell in line.</p>

<p>“That will do,” interrupted Jack-in-the-Pulpit,
“that will do for the Rose family; we will now—”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” interrupted Mary Frances, “but
may I ask—if all these are members of the Rose
family?”</p>

<p>“There’s no mistake,” replied Jack. “Now, if
you stop to think, you’ll realize how very much the
blossom of the cherry, and the strawberry, and the
blackberry, and the peach, and the apple resemble
a wild rose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I do!” said Eleanor.</p>

<p>“And I remember also,” added Mary Frances,
beaming, “that the seed pods of the roses look like
fruit.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Jack, dancing around.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Bet, bouncing around, and all the
members of the Rose families who were present
formed a “ring-around-a-rosy,” and danced around
and around, and at length formed into line near the
bush through which they had come.</p>

<p>“Their caps are their blossoms!” exclaimed
Eleanor.</p>

<p>“They are,” said Bouncing Bet. “Oh, you will
always be on the lookout now to find other members
of that family, for there are many more. I
wanted to call <i>Bridal Wreath</i>, but there wasn’t
time.”</p>

<p>“No time, indeed,” interrupted Jack. “Now,
Bet, call the Night Shade family. They are not so
pretty as the Rose family,” he whispered, “but just
as useful.” Bouncing Bet blew upon her fingers.</p>

<p>“Indian file,” she called, and out filed several
members of the—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Night Shade Family</span></h3>

<p>There were:</p>

<p><i>Common Night Shade</i>, a tiny round black pill-like
berry with a tiny white cap.</p>

<p><i>Sand Burr</i>, in a buff coat full of prickles. And
what do you think? There was—</p>

<p><i>Common White Potato</i>, with a ridiculously small
bell-shaped green and white cap.</p>

<p>“Oh,” Mary Frances could not help exclaiming;
“is White Potato a member of the Night Shade
family? I thought night shade was poison!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t poison—I ain’t! Not after I’m cooked!”
growled Potato. “You’ve ate up enough of my
brothers and sisters to know that!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” admonished Bouncing Bet. “Keep still!
That’s terrible grammar, even though you are a common
‘Tater,’ you ought to speak more correctly than
that.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, but we’ve fed hundreds and thousands
of people, and that’s more than any of the
rest of you can say, even if you don’t like my grammar.”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” cried a <i>Tomato</i>, running in. “Did you
forget me?” He was dressed in a bright red, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
wore a tiny yellow cap trimmed with green. “I
belong to the Night Shade family, too, and I have
fed hundreds and hundreds of people.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you Love Apple!” broke in Potato. “Your
relatives haven’t fed people as long as mine have.”</p>

<p>“That must be so,” said Mary Frances. “I remember
that my grandma told me that when her
mother was young, tomatoes were called love apples,
and were thought to be poisonous. Grand-mothers
raised them in their gardens, though, because they
were pretty.”</p>

<p>“Poisonous!” Tomato’s face turned redder than
ever. “Poisonous! Well, I should say! But then,
you know how good we are, and that we are excellent
for people who eat too much meat.”</p>

<p>“Indeed we do know, don’t we, Mary Frances?
We have some of you in our lunch basket,” laughed
Eleanor. “Mary Frances has a lot of you growing
in her garden, too.”</p>

<p>“Has she any of my brothers and sisters growing
in her garden?” asked a new voice.</p>

<p>The girls saw the funniest, fattest brown fellow
waddling along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello, Humpty Dumpty!” cried out Tomato.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” declared the new-comer, “I’m not
Humpty Dumpty! I can prove it; I can fall and
you can pick me up again. See?”</p>

<p>With that, over he went, smash!</p>

<p>The other Night Shade people all ran to help him up.
“How’s that, young ladies?” said he when they
had set him on his tiny legs. “Doesn’t that prove
I’m not an egg? Humpty Dumpty, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you <i>Egg Plant!</i>” cried Potato. “Welcome,
cousin. You’re another useful member of the Night
Shade family.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps ‘you-all’ don’t like me as well as those
other Night Shades, but some folks do.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” asked Eleanor.</p>

<p>“It looks like Lucinda Marguerite, my colored
paper doll,” replied Mary Frances, laughing.</p>

<p>No wonder she thought so, for the owner of the
new voice looked like a little darky, dressed in green,
with a long-pointed white cap.</p>

<p>“Some folkses likes me bettah than food,” went
on the speaker. “You can just put that in your pipe
an’ smoke it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Tobacco!</i>” guessed Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Oh, how funny!” cried Eleanor, and they burst
into gales of laughter.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know tobacco had such a pretty blossom,”
said Mary Frances, examining the pointed cap
more carefully.</p>

<p>“That will—-” Jack-in-the-Pulpit began.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, wait a minute,” cried a new
voice, and in danced a beautiful little lady, dressed
in a fluffy-ruffly skirt made of flower petals.</p>

<p>“Guess quickly,” smiled Bouncing Bet. “Quickly!”</p>

<p>“<i>Petunia</i>,” guessed Eleanor. “We have them in
a window-box at home.”</p>

<p>“What a pretty member of the Night Shade
family,” said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Fall in line,” Jack commanded, leaning far out
of his pulpit, and pointing out a place where the
Night Shade family took their position.</p>

<p>Then she introduced the others:</p>

<p>Such a number of flower people came dancing
and running in that it was difficult to see who was
who, with the exception of the big Sunflower who
led them.</p>

<p>“I’m <i>Daisy</i>,” called a charming gold and white
flower fairy. “And I love everybody, no matter

“And me!” begged <i>Dahlia</i>, and <i>Goldenrod</i>, and <i>Aster</i>,
and <i>Cosmos</i>.</p>

<p>“And me!” said the <i>Bachelor’s Button</i> in a deep
masculine voice.</p>

<p>“And me!” repeated a dudish-looking <i>Dandelion</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
at whose comical dress the girls couldn’t help
smiling, for he was rigged up in the height of an
old-fashioned style, with a high collar and a knotted
green tie; with “pumps” on his feet—and he carried
a grass-blade cane!</p>

<p>“I know they love me!” There stood <i>Black-eyed
Susan</i>, with arms akimbo.</p>

<p>“We’ve loved you for years!” declared the girls.</p>

<p>“Here comes that <i>Everlasting Flower!</i>” exclaimed
Dandelion.</p>

<p>“What a way to speak!” whispered Eleanor; but
the speech of Dandelion was soon explained when a
crisp Strawflower, or “Everlasting,” came stiffly in.</p>

<p>“Everlastingly late,” said the new-comer dryly,
“but nothing like so common as some flowers,” glancing
at Dandelion.</p>

<p>“Don’t disgrace the family by quarreling,” warned
the big Sunflower.</p>

<p>“It’s so hard to keep such a big family straight,”
he said with a sigh, yet he went on proudly, “You
see, ours is the very largest flower family. There are
from 11,000 to 12,000 members of the Sunflower or
Composite Family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder how many different kinds of plants
are known,” said Mary Frances to Eleanor.</p>

<p>“About 120,000,” answered Jack, who overheard
from his pulpit. “I wish we could show you all the
different flower families, and tell you about them,
but as we haven’t time, we will explain about just a
few more. Bet, will you begin?”</p>

<p>Then Bouncing Bet began to speak in her sweet
musical voice.</p>

<p>“The <i>beans</i> and <i>peas</i> you eat belong to the same
family as the <i>clover</i>. It is the <i>Pulse</i> family. The
<i>cranberry</i> and the <i>honeysuckle</i> and the <i>rhododendron</i>
and <i>trailing arbutus</i> are of the <i>Heath</i>
family.”</p>

<p>“And may I ask,” interrupted Mary Frances,
“to what family you belong?”</p>

<p>“And Jack?” added Eleanor, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Thank you for the questions, dear children,”
smiled the delighted little fairy. “I will tell you:
<i>Jack-in-the-Pulpit</i> belongs to the <i>Arum</i> family. Calla
lily and——”</p>

<p>Here the fairy looked at him and giggled. “Shall
I tell them, Jack?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go ahead,” replied Jack a little grimly. “Maybe
they better hold their noses while you mention that
other member of my family,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Well, the beautiful white calla lily and—and—”
Bet hesitated.</p>

<p>“Say on,” said Jack, “or I’ll tell, myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, Skunk Cabbage, then,” said Bouncing Bet,
“<i>Calla Lily</i> and <i>Skunk Cabbage</i> belong to Jack-in-the-Pulpit’s
family.”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” Mary Frances exclaimed before she
knew it.</p>

<p>“Oh,” gasped Eleanor.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon—indeed, I do!” said Mary
Frances to Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” he replied, “I must say we
are not very proud of that branch of the family,
but they have one thing about them which is very
interesting. They are the very first flowers in the
Spring—oftentimes blooming in February. There
are other members of the <i>Arum</i> family, though, of
which we are prouder.”</p>

<p>“He’ll tell you about them later,” smiled Bouncing
Bet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your family isn’t the same as his, then?” queried
Eleanor.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, “I belong to the <i>Pink</i> family.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” asked Mary Frances, “are all your family
pink in color?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Jack answered her. “She’s all dressed
up in her Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes. She just
borrowed that ‘queen’s lace’ gown. <i>Queen’s</i> lace
belongs to Wild Carrot, you know, and <i>Wild Carrot</i>
belongs to the <i>Parsley</i> family. Run, Bet, and take off
your party clothes. Dress in your own clothes; then
they’ll recognize you.”</p>

<p>Bet bounced away, laughing, and returned almost
immediately in her every-day dress of—you know,
calico-and-gingham-like petals.</p>

<p>“Now we know you, Miss Bet,” cried Mary
Frances; “but even your every-day dress is light
pink! Are you sure all your family doesn’t wear
pink all the time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Bouncing Bet, “you’ll soon
see that that is not the case when I mention my
cultivated cousin, <i>Carnation;</i> and another cousin,
<i>Sweet William</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you’ll be glad to know also,” laughed Jack,
“that among her relatives is <i>Dusty Miller</i>.”</p>

<p>“Now, Jack,” laughed Bet, “that’s an old joke
of yours! Please go on and tell something about
some other members of your own family.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JACK cleared his throat and began:</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want to seem to be too proud
or conceited, but to me it is quite a pleasant
thing to think that the roots of Jack-in-the-Pulpit,
or <i>Indian Turnip</i>, which is my other name, have been
used as a medicine many a time; and that the roots
of my cousin <i>Calamus</i>, or <i>Sweet Flag</i>, are valuable
as a tonic. Some of the <i>Arum</i> family like dry
soil and some like damp, marshy places. I do
not like very dry places myself, and Cousin Calamus
Sweet Flag likes his feet wet all the time.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it wonderful,” Mary Frances leaned forward
in her interest. “Isn’t it wonderful, how plants
growing side by side are so different?”</p>

<p>“They eat the same things, yet are so different,”
smiled Bouncing Bet. “For instance, isn’t it surprising
that an onion and a lily may grow side by side?
By the way, the <i>Onion</i> and <i>Lily-of-the-Valley</i> and <i>Tiger
Lily</i> and <i>Day Lily</i>, and <i>Hyacinth</i>, and <i>Dog-toothed-Violet</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and <i>Solomon’s Seal</i>, and, yes, <i>Asparagus</i>, all
belong to the same family.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” murmured the girls, “to think that the
onion and the lovely Lily-of-the-Valley are cousins
and belong to the same family!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Onion is cousin of <i>Easter Lily</i>, and <i>Tulip</i>
too,” Bet added.</p>

<p>“What about Water Lilies?” asked one of the girls.</p>

<p>“Now,” answered Bouncing Bet, “you’ve mentioned
another member of the same family as the
onion, for by this time, no doubt, you have guessed
that I am naming members of the <i>Lily</i> family. <i>Water
Lily</i> is one of their greatest beauties. How she ever
manages to be so fragrant, so lovely, living in mire
and slime, only her Maker knows. She is our dearest
Water Baby.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please tell us of more Water Babies,” begged
the girls.</p>

<p>“There’s a whole family of big water babies, that
you know well,” Jack broke in. “That is the <i>Cattail</i>
family.”</p>

<p>“How interesting!” cried Mary Frances. “I
thought cats didn’t like water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then the silvery bell of the fairy clock struck
the half-hour and Jack turned toward all the fairy
flower folks who were present.</p>

<p>“Time’s up! Thank you, kind friends,” said he,
“and now, after a dance, you may go.”</p>

<p>With that, the sweetest music the girls had ever
heard began to play, and the fairies began to dance,
keeping time perfectly with their tiny feet.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s a dream, and that I’ll wake up,”
whispered Eleanor to Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“So am I!” Mary Frances whispered back, and
took hold of her little friend’s hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly the music stopped and every fairy except
Jack and Bet disappeared.</p>

<p>“It was so beautiful,” said Mary Frances, still
speaking in a whisper, “that we can never thank
you.”</p>

<p>“We’re so glad you enjoyed our little surprise,”
Jack replied, “for it shows how you love us flowers.
Now I want to tell you something about the way in
which we grow, and how to feed us. You have a
garden, and I feel certain you would like to hear
about that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve studied quite a little about seed-babies,”
replied Mary Frances. “I love the little things
dearly.”</p>

<p>“Good,” cried Bet; “you’ll love them even
more after you’ve heard what Jack is going to tell
you.”</p>

<p>“Do water babies grow in the same way as other
plant babies?” asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“In quite the same way,” replied Jack. “I’m
going to show you how the roots of plants take up
the food needed, and how the leaves help make that
food right for their digestion.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought—” began Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Yes?” asked Jack, expectantly.</p>

<p>“I thought that plants breathed with their leaves.”</p>

<p>“Well, they do breathe with their leaves too, but
they also breathe with their stem surface; or, in trees,
with the surface of the trunk. In fact, they breathe
all over.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Eleanor, “that I’ve been taught
to wash the leaves of house plants in order that
the leaves might get air.”</p>

<p>“Very wise, indeed,” said Jack. “Air is very,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
very important to the leaves, as you will see when
I have told you about their way of growing.”</p>

<p>Just then he took a tiny silver bugle from his
shoulder and blew a long note.</p>

<p>Four little elves appeared. They were dressed
in light brown and dark brown leaves. On their
heads, each wore a cap of a different color. One was
red; one was yellow; one, tan; and one, pink. They
all stood “attention,” looking at Jack.</p>

<p>“Bring in the magic tree,” said Jack, and off ran
the elves.</p>

<p>In a moment they returned, half carrying and half
dragging a plant which looked like a tiny tree. It
was growing in a glass tub, which, although small,
seemed a heavy burden for the little fellows.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mary Frances sprang up. “Oh, please,
let me help,” she begged as she stooped down to
take it.</p>

<p>“Better not, better not,” warned Jack. “That
is a fairy tub and will go to pieces if you touch
it.”</p>

<p>By that time the little elves had it in place, and
they smiled their thanks to Mary Frances as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
wiped the perspiration from their foreheads with tiny
handkerchiefs made of colored Autumn leaves.</p>

<p>Jack jumped down from his pulpit.</p>

<p>“That will do, attendants,” he said. “Thank
you,” and the little elves ran away.</p>

<p>“We have here,” he continued, “a fairy view of the
way in which plants grow. Come, Bet!”</p>

<p>With that, both the little fairies sprang to the top
of the tub, and a wonderful thing happened.</p>

<p>The tub and the tree began to grow so fast that
before you could count three, they were as high as the
girls’ knees, and before you could count seven, the top
of the tree was even with Eleanor’s head.</p>

<p>“That’s tall enough, tree,” cried Jack, and both
tub and tree stopped growing.</p>

<p>“Can you see, young ladies,” he asked as he bent
over the side; “can you see the roots of the magic
tree through the glass?”</p>

<p>The girls could see them plainly.</p>

<p>“Did you notice how they pushed their way
through the stones and pieces of rock, and even moved
them as they grew!”</p>

<p>“I did!” answered each of the girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought it wonderful,” continued Mary Frances,
“but I supposed it was a fairy way of growing.”</p>

<p>“No,” Jack shook his head; “that is the way all
plants grow, whether small or large, only they grow
slowly. Notice the smallest roots. They are hollow
and have very thin delicate coverings.”</p>

<p>“You will see why in a minute,” he went on, “but
now I wish to call your attention to something else.
In between the stones and sand you will notice decaying
leaves and——”</p>

<p>“Humus!” cried Mary Frances jumping up in
excitement.</p>

<p>“Good!” he said. “Humus soup is what the plants
eat. The tiny roots draw it up through their thin
walls. In the humus soup is not only decaying vegetable
matter, but very tiny bits of mineral matter, too—like
pepper and salt for the plant, maybe.”</p>

<p>The girls laughed.</p>

<p>“Listen!” he went on earnestly; “for any plant
to produce one pound of dry matter, the roots must
take up from 300 to 500 pounds of water.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now, I see why plants must have water,”
said Mary Frances. “Now, I understand why it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
so necessary to cultivate—to hold the moisture in the
ground.”</p>

<p>“To make humus soup,” Eleanor added.</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Jack, rubbing his tiny hands in glee.
“It’s splendid to teach such interested persons. It
took human beings many, many years to find these
things out. If only their eyes and ears had been open
to us fairy folks, it wouldn’t have taken so long.”</p>

<p>“Now, human people, in growing garden plants,
want to give them the best kinds of food,” he continued.
“So, after studying to find out what is in the
soil that plants need most, they have gathered those
things together from various places, and have made
Commercial Fertilizers.</p>

<p>“They are to be had in a powdered form, and are
very concentrated plant food. Nothing is better to
use, however, than barnyard manures.”</p>

<p>“One of the best commercial fertilizers is Nitrate
of Soda.” (See Chapter LVIII entitled, “Some Hints
on Growing Vegetables.”)</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHAT becomes, please, of the humus soup
after the plant roots take it up?” asked
Mary Frances thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonderful story,” Bouncing Bet spoke in
her sweet voice. “You see, the plant food soup is
carried up into the larger roots, into the sapwood of
the tree, into the branches and into the leaves; and the
leaves——”</p>

</div>
<p>“Give us shade!” Eleanor did not realize that she
had interrupted.</p>

<p>“They do,” smiled Bet. “But that is not their
work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do leaves work?” Eleanor was surprised.</p>

<p>“They work very, very hard,” Bet replied. “They
do such wonderful work that a leaf has been called a
leaf factory, or a leaf-mill.”</p>

<p>“You think that leaves do not resemble the factories
or mills you have seen,” went on the fairy. “It
is not in appearance that they resemble mills and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
factories, but in the work they do; for they manufacture
starch. I suppose there is really no starch in
the whole world that leaves have not made.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed Mary Frances; “even the starch
in our dresses—is that made by leaves?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bet smiled, “even that; and the starch in
your bread and the——”</p>

<p>“Tell them the story, Bet,” said Jack, who was
much interested.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the little fairy, turning to
pick a leaf from the magic tree. “Please do not interrupt,
and I will tell you about—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Leaf-Mill</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nothing can grow without the right kind of food.</p>

<p>Plants cannot use the “plant-food soup,” just as it is taken
up by the roots, to make new growth.</p>

<p>The leaves must first turn the liquid food into <i>starch</i>, which
is the right kind of food for the plant.</p>

<p>A leaf has been called a leaf-mill, because it has many tiny
grinding stones.</p>

<p>These tiny grinding stones are the green grains in the cells
which form the leaf. They are called <i>chlor-o-phyll</i> bodies.</p>

<p>The leaf-mill grinding stones are turned by sunshine power.
Without sunshine they cannot work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>By the leaf-mill grinding stones, a gas from the air (carbonic
acid gas) is mixed with the plant food soup sent up by the plant’s
roots, and starch is formed.</p>

<p>While doing the work of manufacturing starch, the leaf-mill
throws off into the air another gas, called oxygen. Oxygen is
needed by all animals; carbonic acid gas (or carbon dioxide) is
needed by all plants whose leaves make starch.</p>

<p>But even the starch must be changed before the plant can
use it to make new growth. It must be made into sugar!</p>

<p>So the leaves act as stomachs, and digest the starch they
have made for the plant’s use. In them, in some wonderful way,
the starch is changed into sugar, and some mineral matter from
the humus soup is mixed with the sugar. This combination forms
a perfect food, ready for the plant to make into new growth.</p></div>

<p>“Isn’t it a wonderful story?” asked Bouncing Bet,
as she finished speaking.</p>

<p>“It’s the most surprising garden story I’ve yet
heard,” declared Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“I’ll never, never think of leaves again as just
‘for shade,’” declared Eleanor. “But I’m glad they
do give shade,” she added.</p>

<p>“Trees give a great deal of shade,” said Bet,
“because they expose as large a surface of leaves as
possible to the sun. On a large tree, nearly half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
an acre of leaf surface may be in the sunlight at
once.”</p>

<p>“And the sunlight turns the grinding-stones of the
leaf-mill,” said Mary Frances softly.</p>

<p>“And they make food for the tree,” Eleanor
whispered.</p>

<p>“Sometimes a plant does not need for immediate
use all the food the leaves have made,” Bet continued,
“so it stores it away for future use: sometimes,
in roots; sometimes, in leaves; sometimes
in other parts of the plant—as in the grains of
wheat.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how the storage places look,” said
Eleanor.</p>

<p>Bet laughed. “You’ve often seen some of them,”
she said. “When you eat turnips and beets, you are
eating the food stored in the roots of these plants.
When you use onions, you are using food stored in
leaves.”</p>

<p>Mary Frances thought the fairy had made a mistake,
and Bet seemed to read her thought.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she laughed, “I’m not mistaken. You
see, the bulb of the onion is made up of the thickened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
lower ends of the leaves, the top green parts of which
have dried off.”</p>

<p>“It is interesting,” she went on, “to see how quickly
the plants which have stored food begin to grow when
put into the warm place. It is because of this fact
that bulbous flowers are the first to bloom in the
Spring. They do not have to make food to begin to
grow, for their food is ready for use, and just a little
warmth and moisture will start them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see why crocuses, and hyacinths, and
tulips bloom so early,” said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Bet, “and it is an interesting
experiment to make a carrot hanging basket. Cut
the top off a large carrot and scoop out a hollow.
Fill the hollow with water, and hang the carrot in a
warm room. The beautiful green leaves will soon
grow, using the material stored in the root for food.”
Just at this point, Jack stepped forward.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said he, “to interrupt such an interesting
lesson, but as we have so little time, by your
leave, Bet, I will commence my story about some of
our most peculiar relatives—if the young ladies would
enjoy hearing about them.”</p>

<p>“Before I begin to tell you about our peculiar
relatives, some of which kill, some of which
steal——”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Oh!” muttered Mary Frances.</p>

<p>Just at that moment out of the bushes ran the
tiniest, littlest bit of a dog that ever lived.</p>

<p>At first the girls didn’t see him, he was so small.</p>

<p>He ran right to Jack, and put a tiny bit of paper
in his hand.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake, Bet,” Jack exclaimed, “I forgot
to send back the magic tree and here’s the Queen’s
messenger with a command from Her Majesty! Oh,
oh, oh!”</p>

<p>“Will it be all right if he sends it back immediately?”
Bet asked of the tiny dog, whose head she
was patting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The dog wagged his tiny tail and stood on his hind
legs. Bet bent her ear to his mouth.</p>

<p>“It will be all right,” she said aloud, “if you return
it this minute.”</p>

<p>“Attendants!” shouted Jack. “Attendants!”</p>

<p>Out ran the tiny elves.</p>

<p>“Take back the magic tree!” commanded Jack,
“and apologize to Her Majesty for keeping it over
time.”</p>

<p>He took a little box out of his pocket. Opening it,
he shook out a shining powder, and before the girls
could see how it came about, the tiny tree just as they
first saw it, growing in the little tub, was before them.
The elves sprang to its sides. The little dog ran on
before; and elves, dog and tree vanished from sight.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have had it late for anything!” Jack
spoke sadly.</p>

<p>“You were teaching us so kindly,” said Mary
Frances; “that was the reason you forgot. Oh, I’m
so sorry.”</p>

<p>“If you appreciate my lesson so much,” Jack
said, smiling, “the Queen won’t mind at all.”</p>

<p>“How glad we are!” cried the girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now,” Jack went on happily, as Bet danced
around; “now, I will begin a story about one
cousin—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Wicked Innkeeper</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As you know, plants hang out signs to attract Mrs. Bee and
Mrs. Butterfly and other insects to the feast they have spread—the
pollen and the nectar feast. The signs are the attractive colors
of the flowers.</p>

<p>One flower that hangs out a very pretty little white sign is the
Sundew. The sign seems to say to the passing fly or gnat, “Come,
rest upon one of my pretty, sparkling leaves, and take a meal at
my pretty white blossom-table. Stop at Sundew Inn.”</p>

<p>The little fly is charmed with the cordial invitation, and lights
down upon one of the leaves which glisten all day with a substance
that looks like dew.</p>

<p>In a moment, he knows his mistake, for the sparkling drops
are a sticky fluid which holds the little fellow fast, and the tiny
hairs on the leaf’s surface bite him like so many mosquitoes!</p>

<p>The leaf rolls up a little, and more of the sticky fluid pours
upon him. It is the digestive fluid of the plant. The wicked
Sundew Innkeeper is eating up his guest!</p></div>

<p>“Just like the Spider and Fly in the old story,”
said Mary Frances, repeating the lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘Will you walk into my parlor?’</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Said the spider to the fly,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">‘’Tis the prettiest little parlor</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That ever you did spy.’”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Exactly!” agreed Jack. “The sundew invites
the fly for the same reason that the spider does—because
it needs it for food.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” shuddered Eleanor, “do plants eat animals?”</p>

<p>“Not if they can help it,” replied Jack. “Many,
many years ago, when the sundew’s great-great-great-great-grandparents
were unable to find the kind of food
they needed, they developed this method of getting
nitrogenous food, to keep from starving.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said Mary Frances, looking wise.</p>

<p>“Is the sundew the only plant which eats insects?”
asked Eleanor; “and does it grow around here?”</p>

<p>“It grows in every section of this country,” replied
Jack, “and also in Europe and Asia.”</p>

<p>“The Pitcher Plant, which is found in soggy
marshes, eats insects, too,” he went on; “only it
manages in a different way. Its leaves are shaped
like vases or pitchers, and are usually half filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
water; its flowers are reddish purple in color, easily
deceiving the flies into thinking they are meat. The
insects are attracted also by the sweet fluid, which is
on the edge of the ‘pitcher,’ and crawl or slide down
the slippery hairs which line the upper part.</p>

<p>“Once down, the bristly hairs prevent them from
climbing back, and they are drowned in the water.
The plant eats the soup which their bodies make.
The form of Pitcher Plant which grows in the western
states has vases large enough to drown small birds
and field mice.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a pretty story,” commented Mary
Frances.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” agreed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“It would make us ashamed, wouldn’t it, Jack,”
Bouncing Bet was speaking, “if anybody but Mother
Nature had invented that way of keeping things
moving?”</p>

<p>“She must have had good reason,” replied Jack.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dodder</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No plant would invite such a miserable pauper as a visitor.
It’s worse than any beggar you have ever known, for a beggar at
least digests his own food.</p>

<p>Not so with dodder. It is too lazy to do even that! It has
therefore, no leaves. It doesn’t need them. It starts out as an
honest plant baby, but soon “goes wrong,” reaching out long
tendrils by which it takes hold of any convenient plant neighbor.
It sends little leg-like suckers down into the stem of this plant
neighbor. It lets go of the earth with its roots, and drinks the
life-blood, or sap, of its host, the plant on which it has seized
hold.</p>

<p>The disgracefully lazy dodder does no work at all except to
make flowers and seeds. The flowers are tiny, star-shaped, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
yellowish, greenish or white color, and each flower makes four
seeds to go on to make more thieving plant babies!</p></div>

<p>“Isn’t it disgraceful!” exclaimed Bet. “Jack and
I never want to associate with plants that murder
and steal——”</p>

<p>“Not if we can help it,” said Jack, “we don’t.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be sorry,” he went on, “to learn that
Indian pipes, too, are uninvited guests, living on food
in other plant roots.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mary Frances regretfully, “I always
thought them so pretty!”</p>

<p>“Well, they are pretty, and dodder, even, is pretty
in a way, because of its yellow color, but both are—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Parasite Plants</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Parasite means “eating at another’s table.”</p>

<p>Parasite plants are those which fasten upon other plants and
steal their food.</p>

<p>Real parasite plants lack all green color, for since they steal
food already digested, what need have they for green matter
(chlor-o-phyll) by means of which a plant digests its food?</p>

<p>There are also some half parasites, which, while living partially
upon stolen food, get some food for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>The pretty waxy Christmas mistletoe is a half parasite.
You notice that it has some green coloring or chlor-o-phyll, which
it uses to digest the nourishment it gathers from the air.</p></div>

<p>“My,” exclaimed Eleanor, “I’m glad it doesn’t
steal all its food. That shows it’s trying to help itself.
It isn’t such a ‘piggy’ as some plants!”</p>

<p>“Oh, not every parasite plant destroys the plant
whose food it takes. Not very long ago, human
beings found out that the very tiny parasite plants
which fasten themselves to peas and beans and
other similar plants (called Legumens) are very beneficial
to them. They do steal some predigested food,
but in return they give to them a much more valuable
food, which they have taken from the air. This valuable
food is nitrogen.</p>

<p>For this reason, these parasitic plants, or nitrogerms,
have been gathered and grown, and are now sold
under the name of ‘Cultures for Legumens.’ When
applied to peas, beans, clover, etc., they cause them to
grow very rapidly, and give very abundant crops.”</p>

<p>“How wonderful!” said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>Just then the fairy clock chimed four.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“COME,” cried Bouncing Bet. “Now, I am

plants travel? I mean that they travel without the

<p>“No,” the girls shook their heads.</p>

<p>“You can’t deny that they spread from place to
place, can you?” asked Bet.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I can’t,” said Mary Frances; “the
dandelions have spread all over our land within a
short time.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell you how they did it,” Bet went on.
“But first I’ll tell you—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Why Plants Travel</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If the seeds of a plant always fell on ground nearby, the space
would soon become choked up, and the new seed babies would
have no chance to live; so, many plants have been provided means
of sending their seed babies a long distance from the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
plant, and in this way they have spread or traveled from place to
place, until some cover very large areas.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">How Plants Travel</span></h3>

<h4><i>Seed Pods with Burry Coats</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Did you ever think, when you pick “beggar lice” and “sand
burrs” off your clothing and throw them down on the ground, that
you are helping the plant mother do just what she wanted you to
do with her seed baby?</p>

<p>She put “stickers” all over the coat of her seed baby so that
it might catch hold of your dress, or of the fur of your doggie, or
your cow, and be dropped in a new place where the seed baby
could grow with better chances than at home near her.</p>

<p>When you make burr baskets out of the sticky burdock
seeds, unless you burn them, you are helping the burdocks to
travel.</p></div>

<h4><i>Pods which Shoot Seeds</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The mother plants of the “spider plant,” and of the pansy,
and of the violet send their seed babies to new homes by using
seed pods which burst open and shoot the seeds far and wide in
all directions.</p></div>

<h4><i>Tumble Weeds</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Some mother plants actually carry their seed babies to new
places.</p>

<p>The “tumble weeds” of the West dry up in Autumn, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
broken off near the roots by the wind, which carries them along
over field and meadow; and everywhere they go, they are dropping
seed babies in new places. If you watch them as they tumble
about you will feel like laughing at their comical appearance.</p>

<p>Now we have come to the fairy seed babies, the—</p></div>

<h4><i>Seed Babies with Wings</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You’ve seen them often—seed babies flying about on the
wings which their plant-mother gave them. Sometimes you have
helped them start to fly.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, you have.</p>

<p>Don’t you remember when you pulled the fluffy head off a
dandelion, and blew it to “see what time it was?”</p>

<p>Of course you didn’t know it, but you sent scores of dandelion
seed babies floating off in the air on their fairy wings. Perhaps
the wind took one up where you left off blowing, and landed it such
a distance away from its old home that it might have seemed like
hundreds of miles to the little thing.</p>

<p>Milk-weed seed babies fastened to their beautiful silky down,
which is so light it floats along like a fairy’s feather, actually
travel on the “wings of the wind.”</p>

<p>Some trees, too, give their seed babies wings. Haven’t the
winged seeds of the maple fooled you into thinking they were
birds or insects of some kind? It has amused you, too, to notice
how far the wings of these seed babies have carried them on the
wind.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“Haven’t the plant mothers provided wonderfully
for their seed babies’ welfare!” exclaimed Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Bet; “back of the plant mother is
another mother—Mother Nature. Oh, but she is
wise!”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Have a Seat on a Toad Stool</span></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“MOTHER NATURE has taught plant mothers
many secrets as to how to take care
of their babies,” Bet continued, “but perhaps
her most amusing trick is the wrapping of certain
seed babies in seed cases which look like worms or
bugs. Did you ever notice the seeds of the castor
oil plant?”</p>
<div>
<img class="split" src="images/i-288a.jpg" alt="page deco" width="114" height="509" />
<img class="split" src="images/i-288b.jpg" alt="page deco" width="520" height="207" />
</div>
<p>“They look exactly like bugs!” Mary Frances
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Almost,” Bet nodded; “probably to make some
bird think it’s going to have a fine meal. When the
seed has been carried a little distance, the bird will
discover its mistake, and drop the seed baby in a
new home.”</p>

<p>“What a cunning trick!” exclaimed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it!” said Mary Frances. “I remember now,
that I once saw on a plant what I thought was a worm,
and when I tried to brush it off, it burst open, letting
the seeds scatter about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if that wasn’t this plant?” Bet asked as
she held up a dried flower head, out of which a worm
seemed to be crawling.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Mary Frances. “What is the
plant called, please?”</p>

<p>“It has a very long name,” Bouncing Bet replied;
“too long for you to remember, I fear; but it means a
‘coiled worm,’ and shows how perfectly one plant
mother has performed this comical trick.”</p>

<p>“I suspect all plant mothers have some trick,”
Mary Frances ventured.</p>

<p>“That leads me to tell you about one kind of plants
we’ve not yet mentioned.</p>

<p>They are the—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plants without Flowers</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If plants have no flowers, you will ask, how can the new baby
plants grow? Can there be seed babies without flowers?</p>

<p>No, flowerless plants do not bear seeds, but they do have
plant babies, otherwise we would not have ferns, mushrooms, and
many other important plants.</p>

<p>The plant babies of flowerless plants come from spores, not
seeds.</p>

<p>Did you ever gather Christmas ferns? They are the ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
which cheer you so with their beautiful green color in the woods
when so many other things are asleep in winter.</p>

<p>On the back of the fern leaves, perhaps you have noticed
little brown rusty-looking spots.</p>

<p>In these spots or spore-cases are the spores. When the spore
cases are ripe, they burst open and throw out the spores which
look like a fine dust.</p>

<p>Each grain of this dust must live in a moist, warm place,
and pass through several changes before a baby fern can grow.</p>

<p>Mosses grow in a similar way. So, also, do—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mushrooms or Toad Stools</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mushrooms are flowerless plants, and they do not grow from
seeds, but from spores.</p>

<p>The spores fall from the pretty gills on the under side of the
umbrella part of the plant.</p>

<p>Of course, since they have no green color, you know that
mushrooms do not make their own food. They, like most other—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fungi,</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">live on dead vegetable matter.</p>

<p>Mushrooms grow by means of thread-like feeders which they
send down into the dead material which they use.</p>

<p>It is a good thing that fungi use dead trees and leaves and
other dead matter for food; otherwise, these things would keep on
piling up!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish to tell you of one kind of fungus, though, which lives
on living material in trees. It is called the—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bracket Fungus</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Perhaps you have thought the bracket-like shelves you have
seen on some tree, pretty.</p>

<p>You did not know, then, that some spores of the bracket
fungi had fastened into a wound in the bark, and had sent long
threads down into the living part of the tree.</p>

<p>The poor tree cannot help itself, and after a while it will die
of starvation because the bracket fungi have used up all its food
material.</p>

<p>So do be careful never to injure the bark of a tree; for wherever
it is torn, it leaves an open wound—just as when you scratch your
finger or your arm.</p>

<p>There are other fungi which you’ve seen oftener than toad
stools. They are—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Molds</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You’ve often seen the mold which comes on bread which has
been left in a rather dark, warm, moist place.</p>

<p>The mold comes from the thousands of germs in the dust in
air. These germs settle down and use anything possible for food,
and send out spore-dust to make more germs.</p>

<p>While they are growing and making spore cases, they appear
as molds and mildews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>The germs in the dust are too tiny to be seen without a
microscope, and their near relatives—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bacteria</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">are about the tiniest of living things.</p>

<p>They grow everywhere. Some do us harm and some benefit
us wonderfully.</p>

<p>Cheese is made out of milk by one of the good kind; another
kind makes vinegar; some other kinds fasten themselves
to the inside of our mouths and bodies, bringing disease, like
typhoid fever and consumption.</p>

<p>When we keep our bodies and mouths and teeth clean, we
help our blood to destroy such bad bacteria.</p>

<p>Sunlight destroys bad germs.</p>

<p>Fresh air destroys bad germs. You should have plenty of
fresh air both day and night.</p></div>

<p>“Pshaw,” said Jack, as Bet finished speaking;
“toad stools are meant for fairies to sit on, and mushrooms
for human beings to eat. What kind of nonsense
are you trying to teach, anyhow, Bet?”</p>

<p>The girls laughed, for they saw Jack wink as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he, “you’ve been standing too long—come,
have a seat on a toad stool?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>With that he ran toward a beautiful white mushroom,
and Bet followed.</p>

<p>When they were seated, Mary Frances asked:</p>

<p>“What is the difference between a mushroom and a
toad stool?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Jack replied, “I guess there isn’t really
any difference, although some people think that toad
stools, if eaten, poison people and that mushrooms are
harmless, but some mushrooms are very poisonous, so
do not try to use any you gather, unless some grown
people know them to be harmless, for some of the most
beautiful would kill you the most quickly.”</p>

<p>“I’ve eaten mushrooms,” said Eleanor, “but they
were canned ones.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they are safe enough,” Bet smiled.</p>

<p>“No,” Bet shook her head, “not until five o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I suppose fairies know,” Eleanor whispered.</p>

<p>Jack began to talk rapidly:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Weeds</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the little plant baby which you love and wish to grow,
weeds are like terribly hungry beasts who steal their food, and
choke them to death, and say:</p>

<p>“Get out of here! I’m a piggy-wig, and I want everything
myself!”</p>

<p>So unless you want your favorite plants to die, you will kill
the weeds in your garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Even if some of your plants do live through the fight, they
are weak and poor from the lack of food, and the hard work they
have been through.</p>

<p>Someone has said that weeds are plants that are not wanted,
and people often find that the less they are wanted, the harder it is
to get rid of them.</p>

<p>You see, most weeds have grown in spite of everything, and
have accommodated themselves to such unpleasant surroundings
that when they find themselves in splendid surroundings, as in
your garden soil, they begin to grow ‘with a vengeance.’”</p></div>

<p>“I know!” Mary Frances laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, we fairy folk want to help you as much
as possible with your garden. I am going to tell you
about—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Some Ways to Rid of Weeds</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of course, one of the best ways is to pull the weeds, never
allowing them to go to seed. That’s best for annual kinds.</p>

<p>But the perennial kind must have the roots destroyed, so
deep digging or ploughing in the Fall is a great help.</p>

<p>Cleaning off the growth and burning it in the Fall kills many
seeds which might “winter over,” and come up in the Spring.</p>

<p>Salt is often used to kill grass in paths and garden walks.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Roman

</div>
<p>Some of the commonest weeds found in the garden are—</p>

<p><i>Lamb’s-quarters</i>, or <i>Pigweed</i>, which is usually very unwelcome
in the garden, but which some people use for “greens.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Roman Wormwood</i>, or <i>Hogweed</i>,
which, from its name, you
can see is troublesome everywhere.</p>



<p><i>Beggar-ticks</i>, or <i>Stick tights</i>.</p>

<p>I guess you know them—</p>

<p>Their seed babies, I mean.
Didn’t you get them all over
your dresses and stockings one
day in the woods?</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Beggar-ticks</span></div>
</div>

<p><i>Smartweed</i> and <i>Knotweed</i> and
<i>Lady’s Thumb</i> all resemble each
other in appearance.</p>

<p><i>Plantain</i> and <i>Rat Tails</i>
(Rib Grass, English Plantain) are cousins in the same
family.</p>

<p><i>Pepper Grass</i> and <i>Shepherd’s Purse</i> are cousins, too, and both
belong to the Mustard family. You’ve often eaten pepper grass
seeds, haven’t you?</p>

<p><i>Field Laurel</i>, or <i>Sour Grass</i>, has leaves with a pleasantly
sour flavor.</p></div>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Mary Frances, as Jack paused,
“but you didn’t mention that if you ‘cultivate’ your
garden, it will kill weeds.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you said that!” Jack replied. “It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the best way to keep weeds out of your garden; but
I was speaking of where they had ‘gotten a
start.’”</p>

<p>“They’re hard to pull sometimes,” remarked Eleanor.
“I’ll tell you how I know. We have just the
tiniest lawn, and father gives me an ice-cream cone for
pulling five cents’ worth of weeds.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that lovely of him!” Jack exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” he went on, “it is not only for the
sake of the plants you want to have grow that you
destroy the weeds, but to protect yourself. For
instance, you wish to kill out all poisonous plants;
such as—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Poison Ivy</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The leaves of poison ivy, if touched, will provoke a painful,
poisonous rash on the skin of most
people. This is caused by the irritating,
acrid juice in the leaves. This juice
probably protects the plant—for instance,
no cattle will enjoy eating it.</p></div>

<p>Remember, the poison ivy vine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
has three leaves on a stem, while its harmless and beautiful
cousin, Virginia Creeper, which resembles it so much, has five
leaves on a stem.</p></div>

<p>Jack stepped forward and showed the girls the
difference in the leaves, just as they are pictured here.</p>

<p>They examined them carefully.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll never mistake poison ivy for that
other plant,” said Eleanor.</p>

of—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Virginia Creeper</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This plant is a native of America, growing everywhere from
Canada southward even to Cuba. It makes a charming decorative
vine on wall and fence.</p>

<p>It will soon repay one for the trouble of carrying a root home
from the woods, for it easily takes root in a new place, and everyone
is delighted with its magnificent brilliant red foliage in the
Autumn.</p></div>

<p>“That sounds like a book, Bet,” exclaimed Jack.
“I think the most interesting thing about Virginia
Creeper is the tiny hand-like ‘clingers’ with which it
holds on to the wall or fence.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some Ways in Which Plants Protect Themselves</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You remember that I told you that the “velvet” fur of the
great mullein keeps animals from eating the leaves?</p>

<p>Well, perhaps you’ve never thought of it, but the prickles
of the rose and blackberry and the thorns of some trees prevent
their being destroyed many and many a time.</p></div>

<p>“Indeed, I know,” laughed Mary Frances. “No
one will ever see me try to pick a wild cactus!”</p>

<p>“Or nettles?” asked Jack, pretending to pick
splinters from his hand.</p>

<p>“I hope your garden never has more weeds than
we saw when we were over there in the moonlight last
evening,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Why, were you in my garden?” Mary Frances
was amazed.</p>

<p>“It looked splendid,” beamed Bet.</p>

<p>“We will come often,” Jack added, “and if we
never see more weeds than last evening, you’ll be
growing wonderful vegetables and flowers.”</p>

<p>“Feather Flop—” Mary Frances began, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>

<p>“I shall come out some evening to see
you, dear fairy folks,” said Mary Frances, “even if
you cannot talk with me. Maybe Eleanor will come,
too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’ll know us when you see us.
I might come as Jack Frost,” Jack answered.</p>

<p>“And I might seem a Luna moth,” said Bouncing
Bet. “But you’ll know we are interested and are
trying to help you.”</p>

<p>“Come,” said Jack, “we have a gift for you.
Here is a package of wild flower seeds which we hope
you will plant.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, oh, thank you!” Both the girls were
delighted.</p>

<p>“There’s only one condition with our gift; you
must never tell anyone about us! If you do, not a
seed will grow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” The tears came into Mary Frances’ eyes.
“Not Mother?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Would the Queen let them tell her mother?”
Jack turned to Bet.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bet, “because her mother believes in
fairies.”</p>

<p>“Indeed she does!” Mary Frances was enthusiastic.
“She knows all about the Cooking People.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” both Bet and Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“The Thimble People.”</p>

<p>They nodded again.</p>

<p>“And the Doll People.”</p>

<p>“The Queen of All Fairies sent them, you know,”
said Jack to Bet.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Bet replied.</p>

<p>“Now for my party dress,” she suddenly sang out,
and with “Excuse me!” ran away.</p>

<p>When she came back she was dressed in the queen’s
lace gown, only it was more gorgeous than before, for
it sparkled with a thousand jewels.</p>

<p>She picked up her dainty pink skirt and began to
dance.</p>

<p>“Isn’t my dress pretty?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Queen’s lace trims well,” she laughed. “Come,
Jack!” And together they danced in mid-air, treading
on nothing.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, dear girls,” they sang. “Good-bye,
little gardeners! Good luck! Remember the fairies
will be watching your gardens!”</p>

<p>Just then Mary Frances noticed a big soap bubble
floating toward the little dancers. Nearer and nearer
it came, and stopped in front of them.</p>

<p>Jack opened a door in the soap bubble, and in they
stepped.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” cried Bouncing Bet, as Jack closed
the door.</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” cried the girls. “Good-bye, kind,
lovely fairy folks!”</p>

<p>Jack and Bet threw kisses to them until the bubble
floated out of sight over the tops of the trees.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Oh, Mary Frances,” cried Eleanor after a short
silence. “Oh, it was the most wonderful thing that
ever happened to me!”</p>

<p>“Well, so this is where you girls were hiding!”
Billy’s voice made both the girls jump. “My, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
gave me a scare! Not a bit of lunch tasted, and not a
sign of you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy,” exclaimed Mary Frances, “how you
startled me! How’s Mother? Could she—could she
come?”</p>

<p>“Mother’s all right,” said Billy, “only Father
thought best for her not to try to come, and sent me
for you girls—Hello! I see you’ve been gathering
wild flowers.”</p>

<p>He had spied the flowers that Jack and Bet had let
them gather.</p>

<p>“Gee! aren’t they beauties! Did you find them
near here? I don’t wonder you forgot your lunch!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy—that reminds me—I’m awfully hungry!”
Mary Frances said, “and I imagine Eleanor
is, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m—I am hungry,” Eleanor spoke as in a dream.</p>

<p>“Well, then, since there are no fairies to bring the
lunch baskets to us, let’s go to the lunch baskets,” said
Billy, picking up the bunches of flowers and leading
the way.</p>

<p>“You’ll need a pail to put these flowers in water,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>When he spoke of fairies, Mary Frances put her
fingers to her lips. Eleanor smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>“Let’s spread supper!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“That will make us late getting home, I fear,”
Mary Frances parleyed.</p>

<p>“No, sir-ee!” Billy smiled, “Father’s going to
drive over for us!”</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t that fine!” cried the girls, opening the
baskets.</p>

<p>They ate as only hungry children can eat.</p>

<p>“Here comes Father—just in time for dessert,”
cried Billy suddenly, and all ran to meet him.</p>

<p>They reached home before dark, and were welcomed
by a smiling mother.</p>

<p>“Our wild flower picnic was a success after all,”
Mary Frances said, kissing her and giving her the
beautiful flowers.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it wonderful?” Eleanor clapped her hands
softly. “Oh, I am so glad I could share Mary Frances’
pleasure!”</p>

<p>“I am as glad as Eleanor,” Mary Frances said.
“I wish every girl and boy, too, could have seen and
heard what we did!”</p>

<p>“So do I, dear,” said her mother. “Shall you
ask Billy to help you plant the seeds of the wild
flowers?” she asked.</p>

<p>“If you think, Mother dear, it wouldn’t be a wrong
story to simply tell him that we got the seeds in the
woods?”</p>

<p>“I think that would be all right,” replied her
mother.</p>

<p>“What about Eleanor’s package?” asked Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Frances. “Shall she keep it until she goes home to
plant in her own garden?”</p>

<p>Her mother hesitated. “I may as well tell you,
girls. I have a wonderful surprise for you, myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell us!” they cried.</p>

<p>“Sit down, then,” she said, and they took their
low chairs to her knee.</p>

<p>“This is my secret. Our dear old friend, Eleanor’s
father, has to go away on business—maybe he will be
gone a year—and Eleanor is to come live with us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely!” cried Mary Frances, throwing
her arms about her friend’s neck and kissing her.</p>

<p>Tears came into Eleanor’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” she said. “I shall miss Father
terribly, but if you and Mary Frances’ father just
adopt me for a while, it will be something like having
my own dear father and mother. What about Bob?
Do you know where he is to be?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear child,” smiled Mary Frances’ mother;
“that is another pleasant surprise. Bob is to go away
to school with Billy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will he study gardening?” cried Eleanor.</p>

<p>“He will, if he wishes, your father said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t that grand!” Eleanor was enthusiastic—then
her face suddenly clouded.</p>

<p>“When will Father go?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Not until the middle of September, Eleanor. He
and Bob are to come visit us the first of the month,
and you are to be with us from now on.”</p>

<p>“You’re to be my sister!” Mary Frances laughed.</p>

<p>“And you may call me Mother, if you wish, dear,”
added Mary Frances’ mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, it seems so cozy and lovely!” sighed the
little girl.</p>

<p>“Well, now, my girlies, since the secrets are told,
why not get Billy to help you plant the wild flower
seeds?”</p>

<p>“All right!” they cried, jumping up and kissing
her before they ran away.</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy! Billy!” they shouted as they saw
him in the garden.</p>

<p>“Here come ‘our twins’,” laughed Billy, turning
toward his father. “I wonder what’s up.”</p>

<p>“Hello, girls,” he answered as they came near.
“What can we do for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy, and Father, have you heard the news?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Of course you have! Eleanor is to be my sister, and
yours, Billy, and she’s to call Father, Father; and
Mother, Mother; aren’t you, dear?” said Mary
Frances, kissing Eleanor, who smiled shyly.</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Billy. “Stop for breath,
Mary Frances, can’t you? If Nell were as bad as
you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy!” chided Eleanor.</p>

<p>“I guess all that Billy means to say,” interposed
his father, “is that we’re all glad that such a good
little girl is to come live with us.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to live up to that reputation, young
lady,” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“And now,” Mary Frances produced the packages
of wild flower seeds, “we want our brother to help
us plant seeds.”</p>

<p>“What kind of seeds are they?” questioned her father.</p>

<p>“Where did you get them?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“We got them in the woods where we gathered the
wild flowers,” answered Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“No wonder I couldn’t find you,” Billy commented.
“Where do you think they’d better be
planted, Father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not near a garden of cultivated flowers,” said his
father.</p>

<p>“No,” Billy remarked, “for we learned that the
cross-fertilization or a mixture of pollen might bring
very poor flowers in the garden if wild ones were
planted too near, and might also fill it up with
weeds.”</p>

<p>“Down in this corner would be a good place, it
seems to me,” said their father, leading the way.</p>

<p>“I’ll be with you as soon as I get my spade and
fork,” called Billy.</p>

<p>Everybody helped, and the bed was soon planted.</p>

<p>“I know they’ll all grow for Jack——” Eleanor
began.</p>

<p>Mary Frances pinched her arm, and Eleanor just
caught herself in time.</p>

<p>“For Jack Frost will not get here soon enough to
harm them,” finished Eleanor.</p>

<p>“He’ll not be here in time to harm the perennial
kind,” Billy said.</p>

<p>“No,” his father took up the thought, “August is
an ideal time to plant the seeds of perennials.”</p>

<p>“We have a number of seeds ready for planting.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Billy turned to Mary Frances. “Where are they,
sister?”</p>

<p>“In the play house,” replied Mary Frances. “Shall
we get them?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her father, “I have plenty of time
now, and I will help Billy, if he will act as ‘master of
ceremonies.’”</p>

<p>“Father, I don’t know such a heap.” Billy’s face
colored.</p>

<p>“Well, son,” said his father, “we’ll all appreciate
your telling us all you can of what you learned. I
know a little theory on the subject myself. I only
wish I could have had training and experience in
gardening when I was a boy.”</p>

<p>“It’s the most interesting subject in the world, I
believe,“ Billy said earnestly.</p>

<p>“Here are the seeds,” cried Mary Frances, as she
and Eleanor came with a number of packages.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“WE bought,” said Billy, taking the packages
in his hand, “only the seeds of the
perennials which are easily grown. It’s
far better to buy the young plants of the more delicate
kinds.”</p>

<p>“I should think so. May we see what you have
here?” asked his father, reading aloud the names
on the envelopes which Billy gave him. They were—</p>

</div>
<p>“Of course,” Billy explained, “all of these seeds
could be started in the early Spring in a sunny window
in the house, or in a hotbed, and transplanted to the
open ground in June; but the advantage in planting
them in July or August is that they will get a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
start before cold weather, and will bloom the next
Summer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wouldn’t they bloom in the coming Summer if
planted in the house very, very early in the Spring?”
asked Eleanor.</p>

<p>“A few, such as sweet williams and gaillardia,
might,” Billy answered, “but it would be quite
uncertain.”</p>

<p>“Do you make the seed bed in just the same way
as for any other seeds?” asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Yes, taking great pains to have it finely pulverized.
Well, let’s get to work! Father, please tell us
what you think is a good place.”</p>

<p>After pointing out a good sunny place, his father
helped Billy make the seed bed, and the girls sowed
the seed.</p>

<p>“Cover the tiny seeds with just a thin layer of
soil,” directed Billy, “but put a heavier cover on the
larger ones. The rule is to cover a seed with three
times its diameter.”</p>

<p>“Next we press them down firmly,” said Mary
Frances, “and sprinkle with water very gently.”</p>

<p>“Good!” her father praised her. “What a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
little gardener you are! By the way, when do we see
that play house garden of yours, dear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Father, that’s to be another surprise!”
Mary Frances answered. “You’re to be invited to
a Garden Party—you and Mother, and other people,
too.”</p>

<p>“Won’t that be fine! I hope you will not forget
Aunt Maria,” her father smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s a part of the secret, Father; please,
please don’t guess any more! And please don’t
tell Mother, will you?” Mary Frances begged
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I shall not, little girl,” he answered. “I
think it is a delightful idea.”</p>

<p>“The bed should be shaded from the hot sunlight,”
Billy went on irrelevantly, “until the plants are quite
large.”</p>

<p>They turned toward him.</p>

<p>“How’s that best managed, son?”</p>

<p>“It can be managed in several different ways,”
said Billy. “For instance, brush may be laid over
the bed, but that is not a very good method. A better
one is to make a—</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese-cloth Shade Frame</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Drive down several stakes on the border and in the center of
the bed.</p>

<p>Make a cover of cheese-cloth to fit over the bed, and fasten
it to the stakes.</p>

<p>You see, the cheese-cloth lets in light and air and rain, yet
protects the little seedlings from the direct hot rays of the sun.</p></div>

<p>“We boys will drive down the stakes if you girls
will make the cheese-cloth cover,” volunteered their
father.</p>

<p>“Sew we will, won’t we, Eleanor?” laughed Mary
Frances.</p>

<p>“Was that a pun?” asked Billy. “Why, Mary
Frances!”</p>

<p>“She meant we will so,” Eleanor tried to explain,
but everybody smiled.</p>

<p>“You do not need to sew if the beds are narrow,
for the cheese-cloth will be wide enough,” Billy said,
“nor if you use another method of shading the seed
beds. I mean if you use—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lattice Shade Frame</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Instead of using cheese-cloth, laths are fastened to the upright
stakes to form a “lattice.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think the cheese-cloth frame would be less trouble
to make.” Eleanor was much interested.</p>

<p>“All right, then,” said Billy. “We’ll expect you
to have your part ready in time.”</p>

<p>“Do you leave the cheese-cloth, or the lattice shade
frame over them all winter?” asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“No.” Billy shook his head. “After the little
plants are about three inches high, you remove the
frame, and let them grow with a will. By the latter
part of September they will be well rooted, able to live
over winter if covered with leaves when the weather
becomes frosty, and sheltered from the north winds.”</p>

<p>Mary Frances shook her little friend into wakefulness.</p>

<p>“Mar-ket—gar-den-ing?” yawned Eleanor, stretching.
Then sitting up, “Oh, yes, I remember now,
Mary Frances! How stupid of me! It’s Saturday!
My, I’m sorry I overslept!”</p>

<p>“Never mind, girlie, but hurry up and dress.
Billy’s already out in the garden putting things in the
wheelbarrow.”</p>

<p>They didn’t take much time for making a fancy
toilet, and were soon out in the play house garden with
Billy.</p>

<p>“Hello, girls,” he called. “Aren’t these green
peppers beauties?” holding some up.</p>

those green peppers are red!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re no Italian,” laughed Billy, “or you
would know that most green peppers turn red when
ripe enough.”</p>

<p>“What else have we to-day?” asked Mary Frances.
“Of course we have our parsley, and lettuce, and
tomatoes, and ‘pot herbs.’”</p>

<p>“And cabbage, and carrots, and beans, and cucumbers,”
added Billy.</p>

<p>“And egg-plants!” Eleanor was proud to be able
to add a name to the list.</p>

<p>“All the articles mentioned, Ma’am,” said Billy,
pretending to offer them for sale.</p>

<p>“I’ll buy everything you have,” answered Eleanor,
“if you’ll sell for a penny.”</p>

<p>“‘Said the piggy, “I won’t!”’” Mary Frances misquoted,
“and I don’t blame Billy, for we’ve made lots
of money this Summer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Eleanor; “from the times I’ve
been out with you selling garden truck, you must have
quite a fortune by now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say——” began Billy.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Why, I was just thinking that since Eleanor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
was always helping us so much, she ought to share in
the profits.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that be fine!” Mary Frances hugged
her friend in delight.</p>

<p>“No.” Eleanor shook her head. “If you divide
among three, you won’t make money nearly as fast.”</p>

<p>“We’ve done so well that we won’t mind going a
little more slowly,” said Billy. “Shall we tell what a
pile we have in the bank, Mary Frances?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy, you know I’m crazy to tell her!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Billy took a book from his pocket, “last
Saturday night we had forty-four dollars and fifty-seven
cents, and Mrs. Dailey owes us two dollars and
nineteen cents.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy, did you two make that much in this
short time?” Eleanor could scarcely believe her ears.</p>

<p>“More than that!” Mary Frances exulted. “And
we’ve paid Billy back the money we borrowed from his
‘prize money’ for seeds.”</p>

<p>“Let me see. Forty-four and two are forty-six,”
said Eleanor. “You may have sixty dollars by cold
weather!”</p>

<p>“More likely seventy, Billy?” asked Mary Frances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve heard of counting dollars before they were
hatched,” Billy laughed.</p>

<p>“Is Nell a partner from now on?” asked Mary
Frances.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Billy said, “if she helps, she shares in the
profits—but, gee, I wish Bob was here!”</p>

<p>“Well, you know he’s coming soon!” said Mary
Frances, “and, besides, you’ll be together the whole
school year!”</p>

<p>“Say, you girls get to work!” exclaimed Billy, and
they flew to gather parsley, and tiny little red peppers,
and thyme, and leeks, out of which Mary Frances made
penny bunches of pot herbs, while Eleanor tied some
three-cent and five-cent bunches of the parsley.</p>

<p>“Are we ready now?” asked Eleanor as Billy piled
the wheelbarrow high with vegetables.</p>

<p>“No, indeedy!” Mary Frances exclaimed. “Now,
it’s my turn. Come on out into the front garden and
help me gather my bouquets.”</p>

<p>“Let me see the order book, Billy, please?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Doctor Hopewell wants roses, larkspurs,
and baby’s breath; Mr. Courtley asked for sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
peas. As we have only the perennial kind which have
no odor, I shall put a sprig of lemon verbena with them.
Aren’t they beautiful?” as she began to gather them.
“I just believe Mr. Courtley is going to give them to
Miss Constance. Last Sunday she wore to church the
bunch of tufted pansies he bought of me on Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Nell, you gather yellow flowers to-day. Isn’t that
right, Mary Frances?”</p>

<p>He handed her a basket.</p>

<p>“In that,” Mary Frances nodded. “You’ll find
scissors inside the play house door.”</p>

<p>Eleanor was soon cutting perennial sunflowers and
coreopsis.</p>

<p>“Billy, get some blue flowers to put with the
coreopsis?” Mary Frances called after a minute, and
Billy began to cut some eupatorium.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this a charming bouquet!” exclaimed Eleanor
as she arranged the blue and yellow flowers.</p>

<p>They all admired it, but they voted the pink roses,
and larkspur, and baby’s breath the most beautiful
of all.</p>

<p>“Now, we’re ready to start!” Billy led off with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the wheelbarrow, the girls following with baskets of
the herbs and flowers.</p>

<p>“Have you planned to do anything special with the
money, Mary Frances?” asked Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, I shall save a good deal for
seeds and plants in the Spring, and Billy says we’ll
plant bulbs in the Fall. That will cost quite a little.”</p>

<p>“And we’re planning to make a hotbed and a cold
frame,” broke in Billy, who overheard.</p>

<p>“And when we started gardening I borrowed quite
a little sum for seeds from my savings account—with
Mother’s permission. I have to put that back,” Mary
Frances added.</p>

<p>“Money, like all good things,” Billy looked wise,
“should be taken care of!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you miser, Billy!” Mary Frances playfully
shook her finger.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it strange what funny ideas some people
have of how things grow?” remarked Billy. “A city
chap at school told me he had always thought that
cabbages grew on vines and potatoes were picked off
bushes!”</p>

<p>“Well, if he never saw them growing, how could he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
know?” Mary Frances reasoned after they stopped
laughing.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” teased Billy. “Stand up for him.”</p>

<p>By that time they were in the heart of the village,
and had very soon sold everything, for the village people
had become accustomed to look for the children.</p>

<p>“Every vegetable you bring is so fresh that we wait
to buy of you,” several said.</p>

<p>“Splendid luck to-day,” commented Billy, on the
way home.</p>

<p>“Have you saved the things your mother ordered?”
asked Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Billy. “You don’t suppose
we’d neglect one of our first and best paying customers.”</p>

<p>“Mother is a dear!” said Mary Frances. “So is
Father! They must wonder why they haven’t been
invited to see our gardens.”</p>

<p>“When are you going to ask them?” Eleanor
inquired.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you remember? When we give our
garden party.”</p>

<p>“That’s to be about the first of September, I
believe,” said Billy.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“THERE!” Mary Frances looked up from her
writing. “That is the last invitation, all
ready for the envelope. Eleanor, did you
hear?”</p>

<p>“I heard,” her little friend laughed, “but I
was so busy putting the last curl to the tail of the
address on the last envelope that I couldn’t pay
attention.”</p>

</div>
<p>“Oh, I am so much obliged to you for addressing
them,” said Mary Frances. “Let me see if I’ve
thought of every one,” laying them aside as she
counted.</p>

<p>“Here is Grandma’s; here, Aunt Maria’s; here,
your father’s; here, Bob’s; and last, but very
important, Mother and Father’s. Let’s go mail
them.”</p>

<p>“What did you say to Aunt Maria?” Eleanor
inquired as they walked along.</p>

<p>“I said,” Mary Frances recited:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

“<span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Maria</span>:—

<p>“Please come to my Garden Party next Wednesday.
We’ve been industrious enough this Summer to
please even you!</p>

<p>“I don’t want to tell you any more, for fear I’ll
spoil the surprise, but we won’t have a bit nice time
unless you are with us. I’ll never forget how pleased
you were with my cooking surprise.</p>

<p>“With love, which I want to give you in real hugs,
and real kisses,</p>

<p class="sig">
“<span class="smcap">Mary Frances</span>.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>“Mary Frances, do you dare hug your Aunt Maria?
I’d never dare, I’m sure. The very thought scares
me! She always seems so cross.”</p>

<p>Mary Frances laughed. “I used to feel the same
way,” she said, “but after I found out that she was
cross just because she was afraid——”</p>

<p>“Afraid? Your Aunt Maria afraid!”</p>

<p>“Yes, afraid, and ashamed that somebody might
think she was loving and kind. When I found that
out, I felt different. I was sorry for her.”</p>

<p>“I know she loves you dearly,” Eleanor admitted.</p>

<p>“She’s a dear old bear who growls just for fun, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
I hope she comes to the party. Grandma will come,
I know, and——”</p>

<p>“So will Father and Bob,” finished Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can scarcely wait for Wednesday!”</p>

<p>They were at the post office by this time. On their
way home they discussed their plans.</p>

<p>“Billy will bring the tables to the play house
on Tuesday,” said Mary Frances, “and we’ll all do
everything we can to get ready.”</p>

<p>“What shall we have for refreshments?” Eleanor
asked.</p>

<p>“Why, I think it would be lovely to have everything
from our garden—of course, excepting the ice-cream,”
Mary Frances laughed. “I wonder how this would be:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary Frances, that sounds perfectly wonderful
to me!” exclaimed Eleanor, “but how can you
manage to serve so many things?”</p>

<p>“It won’t be hard to manage,” Mary Frances
answered, well pleased. “I’ve thought it all out
carefully. We can have the mayonnaise dressing all
ready for the salad the day before, and can make the
sandwiches Wednesday morning if we wrap them in
waxed paper.”</p>

<p>“How do you make those sandwiches, Mary
Frances?” asked Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad you asked that, for they are so
good, Eleanor. Use—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">For Twelve Green Pepper Sandwiches</span></h3>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 five-cent packages cream cheese</li>
<li>2 green peppers, chopped very fine</li>
</ul>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mix together and spread on well-buttered thin slices of bread.
Cover each with another buttered——</p></div>

<p>“As if I didn’t know that much!” exclaimed
Eleanor. “How do you make the other kind?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the nasturtium sandwiches? Why, you use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the chopped stems and a few flowers of the nasturtium
plant between the bread. They taste something like
the daintiest of radishes.”</p>

<p>“I can make the sandwiches!” Eleanor exclaimed.
“They are easy. Now, what about the potatoes?”</p>

<p>“They can be creamed in the morning and warmed
in the oven just before serving.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s fine! What about the spearmint
jumbles you mentioned?”</p>

<p>“I made up that recipe,” Mary Frances confessed.
“You see, I’m so crazy to have everything from the
garden that I just had to be original.”</p>

<p>“I’m wild to hear about this recipe!” Eleanor said.
“Let’s go into the play house and I’ll write it
down.”</p>

<p>When they were seated, Mary Frances began:</p>

<p>“I looked all over the garden, Eleanor, and I
couldn’t think of a thing we could use in making candy,
and I certainly think we need candy, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do!” Eleanor agreed.</p>

<p>“Suddenly I spied the spearmint growing with my
other herbs. ‘The very thing!’ I thought, so I just
made up a very simple recipe for—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spearmint Jumbles</span></h3>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups sugar</li>
<li>½ cup water</li>
<li>1 cup mint leaves</li></ul>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2">1. Wash the mint leaves.</p>

<p class="p2">2. Put the sugar in a saucepan. Add the water.</p>

<p class="p2">3. Stir sugar over the fire until dissolved.</p>

<p class="p2">4. Cook quite hard until the sugar begins to turn brown. Take
from the fire. Add mint leaves, stirring hard.</p>

<p class="p2">5. Turn out on a buttered pie plate. Add 2 tablespoons
butter.</p>

<p class="p2">6. Stir hard until candy falls apart or crumbles into small
pieces.</p></div>

<p>“My, but you are smart, Mary Frances!” declared
Eleanor. “I wish I could do such things—but
what if some people don’t care for spearmint
flavor?”</p>

<p>“We could make some fudge.” Mary Frances
met the suggestion, “but I think everybody ought to
think it good this time because it’s from our garden.
I didn’t like to plan for ice-cream even because it
didn’t grow there.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish it did!” cried Eleanor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>“If it did, I’d have acres of ice-cream plants!”
Mary Frances laughed.</p>

<p>“We’ll cook everything right here in the play
house,” she continued; “that little stove will do all
that we want.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t it be too grand for anything!” Eleanor
hugged Mary Frances in enthusiasm.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So when Tuesday came, they set to work, and
carried out their plans.</p>

<p>“Who’s to serve the feast?” asked Billy, as he
arranged the plates according to the girls’ directions.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll do that,” answered Mary Frances. “All
we ask you to do, Billy, is to open the freezer and dish
the ice-cream.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, you may count on me, ladies,” said
Billy, bowing. “Count on me for a large share in the
ice-cream work, although I can’t see that there will be
much work, for I ordered it in the form of bricks.”</p>

<p>“Billy, you’re a brick!” laughed Eleanor.</p>

<p>By twelve o’clock Wednesday, the refreshments
were ready, and the girls went to the big house to
“doll up,” as Billy said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary Frances glanced out of the window just as
she fastened the last button of Eleanor’s dress.</p>

<p>“Here comes Aunt Maria!” she cried and bounded
down-stairs and out on the porch to meet her. While
she was hugging her, Eleanor’s father and Bob appeared
on the scene, and you can imagine how happy
the little girls were.</p>

<p>“Where can Grandma be?” Mary Frances asked,
after her mother and father had welcomed everybody.
“Oh, there comes the station auto-bus. It’s going to
stop here!” Surely enough it stopped, and out
stepped the dear old lady, whom everybody tried to
greet at once.</p>

<p>In the midst of the confusion, Mary Frances and
Eleanor slipped away to the play house, and a little
later Billy and Bob piloted the guests to the play house
garden.</p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Will show how her garden grows,”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">announced Bob, leading the way up the path, where
Mary Frances shook hands with each one in a most
grown-up, dignified fashion introducing them to “My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
friend, Miss Eleanor,” just as Mother Paper Doll had
done in the Housekeeper story.</p>

<p>“So this is you children’s garden surprise, dear!
Isn’t it beautiful!” There were tears of joy in their
mother’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Were there ever such children!” exclaimed their
grandmother.</p>

<p>“If there are any more wonderful, I have yet to
see them!” Aunt Maria’s nose went up into the
air with pride.</p>

<p>“Jolly good gardener, Bill!” Bob slapped his friend
on the back.</p>

<p>“What you’ll be next year,” Billy retorted.</p>

<p>“Father hasn’t said a word!” Mary Frances suddenly
discovered.</p>

<p>“I’ve been speechless with surprise, dear,” he said.
“It certainly paid to wait to see such a garden. The
flowers are wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Why, haven’t you seen the garden before this?”
everybody asked, and he told the whole story.</p>

<p>As he finished, Bob and Eleanor’s father spoke.
“I’m gladder than ever that Bob’s to go away to
Billy’s school!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Then nearly everybody began to talk at once, saying
how much more sensible the ideals of education
were to-day than when they were young, and more of
such grown-up talk, which gave the boys and girls a
chance to slip away to get the refreshments.</p>

<p>“How did you guess we were hungry?” asked Bob’s
father as Mary Frances served the salad, and Eleanor
passed the sandwiches in a dainty basket, trimmed
with pink bows.</p>

<p>“Where did you find such beautiful lettuce and
tomatoes, dear?” asked Grandma, showing her enjoyment
of the treat.</p>

<p>“That’s part of the secret,” laughed Mary Frances.
“After you’ve tested our vegetables, we’ll show you
our vegetable garden.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Bob, “you don’t mean to say
you raised these?”</p>

<p>“Everything’s from this garden except the ice-cream!”
Eleanor asserted proudly.</p>

<p>“Some farmers!” Bob started to say, but his
father interposed.</p>

<p>“You forget, son, that you’re in a formal social
gathering—at a garden party, if you please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>“Please pardon me,” Bob begged, bowing to the
company.</p>

<p>“Let them talk—it’s the youngsters’ party,” somebody
whispered so loud that everybody heard, and
everybody laughed.</p>

<p>After the ice-cream and coffee had been served, and
the bonbon dish of candy was passed, “What delicious
mints!” so many people praised, that Mary Frances
said she would carry the candy dish with them to the
vegetable garden, and all could see the bed of mint
where she gathered the leaves for the flavor.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to tell you how happy and
proud the children were as they showed their vegetable
garden, with its beautiful neat beds bordered
with nasturtiums.</p>

<p>You can imagine how they looked, for if you read
the garden lists in early chapters of this story, you
know what they had growing.</p>

<p>“Everybody may pick a bouquet,” said Mary
Frances, seizing Eleanor’s hand and leading the
party to the flower garden. Just as they started,
Doctor Hopewell drove up with his son and two
daughters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“We couldn’t help stopping,” he declared. “You
made such a beautiful picture.”</p>

<p>They were welcomed with delight, and the girls
insisted upon their having some salad and ice-cream.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this the most charming thing you ever heard
of!” sighed Marjorie Hopewell.</p>

<p>“It’s just like a girl’s dream come true!” her
sister Helen agreed.</p>

<p>“The girls will never get over this. To have
peace I’ll have to turn farmer yet! Bill and Bob will
have to give me pointers!” their brother Harry
laughed.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I’d like to see you all doing what these
young people have done,” their father told them.</p>

<p>The doctor and his family left in about an hour,
with flowers for Mrs. Hopewell, but the other guests
stayed until five o’clock, sitting on the easy chairs
which Billy had placed along the walk in front of the
play house.</p>

<p>The day was so beautiful—not too warm, not too
cool; not a rain cloud in the sky, but scattered about
with little white fleecy “flocks of lambs” clouds, as
Mary Frances said. Perhaps that and the beauty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the garden made them linger, but they seemed sorry
to leave.</p>

<p>“You will all come again! Soon!” Mary Frances
and Billy made them promise. “And you’ll come to
our garden party next year! We’ll have both Bob
and Eleanor for partners then!”</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Feather Flop’s Conceit</span></small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“OH, Feather Flop! Feather Flop!” called
Mary Frances, as she carried a pan of the
“left overs” of the garden party out to the
rooster the next morning.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>Feather Flop made some queer gurgling noise in
his throat.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter, old fellow?” she asked
in alarm.</p>

<p>“Matter?” cawed Feather Flop hoarsely. “Matter?
Why, this: I’ve nearly crowed my bill off trying
to call you. I’m so hoarse I can scarcely whisper!
I grew so weak, finally I had to lean up against the
fence to crow!”</p>

<p>“Mercy! Was it as bad as that?” asked Mary
Frances. “Why, I must have been so tired out from
our garden party that I slept so soundly I didn’t
hear. I’m sorry—you must have wanted to see me
very particularly, too!”</p>

<p>“‘Our garden party!’” echoed Feather Flop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
“‘Our garden party!’ As though any mention had
been made of me!”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” cried Mary Frances. “Oh, was that
it, Feather Flop? I never thought—really! I supposed
I must keep you a secret just as I’ve been accustomed
with other fairy folks.”</p>

<p>“Fairy folks!” exclaimed Feather Flop. “Fairy
folks! I’m not a fairy! I’m a farmer! and even if
you don’t remember, it doesn’t change the fact that if
it hadn’t been for me, you wouldn’t have had any
garden at all.”</p>

<p>“Why, you conceited old fellow!” cried Mary
Frances. “How do you make that out? But,” seeing
the disappointment on his face, “of course, I appreciate
your help. Indeed I do, Feather Flop,” she added.</p>

<p>“Don’t you recollect?” asked Feather Flop.
“Don’t you recollect that day when you couldn’t
understand the seed catalogue? Who was it that
helped you then? Who was it, little Miss?”</p>

<p>He cocked his head and looked up at her expectantly.</p>

<p>“Why, it was you, Feather Flop!” Mary Frances
exclaimed. “It certainly was you, my old friend!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Feather Flop blinked. “I’m glad you can call it
to mind!” he remarked. “If you had only just mentioned
my name at the garden party, I wouldn’t have
felt so bad.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“Even if you’d just said to me, if you’d just said,
‘Feather Flop, old chap, you can’t come to the garden
party, of course, but you’re invited,’ I wouldn’t have
felt as I did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>“If you’d said at the party, ‘Now, if my old friend,
Feather Flop, hadn’t helped me,’ or something like
that, I’d have been so proud and glad.”</p>

<p>“How do you know I didn’t?” Mary Frances
parleyed under sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>“How do I know? I was there. I was there even
uninvited!” declared Feather Flop.</p>

<p>“Why, where in the world were you?” asked Mary
Frances in astonishment. “You couldn’t have been
in the garden, for we were everywhere.”</p>

<p>“It’s a riddle!” Feather Flop’s voice sounded as
though he was laughing. “I was in the garden!
You can’t guess where!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed, I can’t.” Mary Frances shook her head.
“Unless you were under something inside the play
house.”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t inside the play house,” said Feather
Flop, in a voice which still sounded like laughter.
“Guess again! One more guess!”</p>

<p>“Give it up.” Mary Frances acknowledged her
defeat.</p>

<p>“Why, I was outside the play house on the roof!”
declared the rooster triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Mary Frances, delighted. “So that
is where you were! You really were at the party,
after all! Now I shall feel better. If I’d only realized
how you felt, I’d loved to have invited you and to
have had you there!”</p>

<p>“That makes it all right,” said Feather Flop
brightly. “I only thought you’d forgotten me and
maybe didn’t want me! That’s what made me so
sad!”</p>

<p>“Not want you!” exclaimed Mary Frances. “Not
want you! I think you are the most wonderful rooster
in the whole wide world, and the smartest——”</p>

<p>“Farmer?” asked Feather Flop anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, farmer!” declared the little girl,
picking him up and tenderly smoothing him. “If it
hadn’t been for you, I doubt if I’d have had a garden!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m the happiest rooster in the wide world!”
sighed Feather Flop, “and if I weren’t just a plain
farmer rooster, I’d turn into a fairy prince, dressed in
blue satin trimmed with gold and diamonds, but as it
is—I’m hungry!”</p>

<p>“Come!” laughed Mary Frances. “Come, eat,”
she said. “I like you far better than any fairy prince,
for you’re my own dear friend—my farmer, Feather
Flop.”</p>

<p>And Feather Flop looked so proud you might
have imagined him in tiny overalls and sun hat.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE boys had been at school several weeks, and
Mary Frances and Eleanor were well started
in their studies, when one golden-leafed day in
October, each girl received a letter from her brother
as they stopped at the post office on their way from
school.</p>

<p>“We’re coming home on Friday,” both letters read
alike, “to plant the bulbs, and we’ll expect your help
after school, and all day Saturday, if necessary; and
we’ll hope—just hope—for some play house cooking.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it comical for them to say just the same
thing!” exclaimed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Won’t we have fun!” Mary Frances answered.
“Let’s see, this is Wednesday. I wonder if Billy
wrote to Mother.” And away they flew to find
out.</p>

<p>“Mother, you’ve known for several days, I just
believe,” declared Mary Frances, whereat her mother
laughed and confessed that she had known, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
it was her turn to keep a surprise in store for them.
Then all three fell to making plans for the visit.</p>

<p>“We’ll give a dinner in the play house,” decided
Mary Frances, “and invite you and Father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you children would have more pleasure without
grown-ups,” protested her mother.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of fun without <i>our</i> kind of ‘grown-ups,’
you mean,” Mary Frances contradicted lovingly.
“Doesn’t she, Eleanor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” Eleanor answered emphatically.</p>

<p>“You dear children!” was all the mother said, but
the girls knew that their invitation was accepted.</p>

<p>When the boys came, there was so much to talk
about that they didn’t get to work until Saturday.
There were stories of the jokes which the second year
fellows played on the “Freshies,” and of the winning of
the big football game, and of the rigid training in
athletics, and a volume of other talk new to the girls;
at least, new to Eleanor, and equally entertaining to
Mary Frances and her parents.</p>

<p>“I wrote ‘the governor’ all about that,” said Bob
as he finished relating one particularly amusing
incident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“He means his ‘old man,’” explained Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy! How you talk!” cried Mary Frances.
“Do you mean his father?”</p>

<p>“Sure guess!” nodded Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, Father, if that’s the way they learn to talk,
I shouldn’t think you’d let them go back.” Mary
Frances pretended to be indignant.</p>

<p>But he only laughed, saying, “Oh, they’ll outgrow
it.” And the boys took up anew the threads of their
stories.</p>

<p>It was quite late before they got to bed, but they
were up bright and early Saturday morning.</p>

<p>“We fellows haven’t time now to explain why
bulbous plants bloom so readily in the Spring.”</p>

<p>“We know; don’t we, Mary Frances?” Eleanor
exclaimed without thinking.</p>

<p>Mary Frances pursed her lips to look like “Hush!”
and shook her head, which made Eleanor remember
that Jack-in-the-Pulpit and Bouncing Bet’s lessons
were to be a secret.</p>

<p>“If you know so much, Nell,” Bob replied
mockingly, “perhaps you can tell the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
between a corm, a rhizome, a tuber, and a fleshy
root.”</p>

<p>“Well! Well!” cried Mary Frances, “I guess we
better not lay claim to any more knowledge,” and she
winked at Eleanor, who nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>“But,” said Billy, opening his note-book, “we will
tell you a little something about—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Planting of Bulbs</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Anyone can have flowers which grow from bulbs.</p>

<p>They require so little care that everybody can be cheered
in the early Spring with the sunshine of daffodils, and the fragrance
of hyacinths, and the gay color of tulips; which, after the dullness
of winter, are appreciated more, perhaps, than any other flowers.</p>

<p>Their leaves and flowers being wrapped with their food supply,
in the storage bulbs, it takes only the call of a few days of warmth
and sunshine to bring them into bloom.</p>

<p>So every one should—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plant Spring-Flowering Bulbs in Autumn</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In October or November is the best time of the year for
planting Spring-flowering bulbs; in localities where the Winters
are not severe, December is perfectly safe.</p>

<p>The bulbs should have time to make some roots before the
ground freezes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">How to Plant Bulbs</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bulbs do not like clayey soil, nor do they like dampness;
neither do they thrive on fresh manure.</p>

<p>Remembering this, you already know just about what kind
of soil they need—well-drained, loamy soil, full of humus or well-rotted
manure, and some sand; for sandy soil is needed by all
bulbs.</p>

<p>If you do not have such garden soil, dig quite large holes with
your trowel, and fill them with such a mixture. If you do not have
well-rotted manure, use a sprinkling of bone meal.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Depth to Plant</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A good rule for the depth to plant bulbs is twice their
length; but sometimes it pays to plant them deeper to protect
them.</p>

<p>If planted deeper they come into bloom a little later, but the
protection of the depth may save them from destructive freezing.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Where to Plant Bulbs</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Blooms of bulbs look beautiful anywhere. One need not
hesitate to place them in masses (a number near each other) in
the garden borders, for after they bloom and die down, there will
be no bare spots if some annuals, with short roots, are grown over
them; such as alyssum, ageratum, violas, verbenas.</p>

<p>Plant the low-growing sorts of bulbs in the front, and the
taller kinds in the back of the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Cover, when the ground begins to freeze, with several inches
of dry leaves or grass.</p>

<p>Most bulbs do best if not lifted after blooming; that is, let
them be in the ground for several years. Then the new bulbs
which have grown on the old ones will need to be separated and
planted.</p>

<p>Narcissus and daffodils may remain many years without
disturbing.</p>

<p>Hyacinths do not do as well as other out-door hardy bulbs,
becoming less vigorous each year. They do a little better if the
bulbs are lifted and dried in the Summer and replaced in the Fall.</p>

<p>If you plant—</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bulbs in the Grass</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One caution is necessary: after they are through blooming,
wait until the green leaves turn yellow before cutting the grass.
If the leaves are cut before they turn, the bulbs will die.</p>

<p>Nowhere else do such flowers look so beautiful as in the grass.</p>

<p>To plant small bulbs, such as crocus, dig holes in the turf
with an apple-corer, or with a “dibble,” which is a pointed stick.
Throw in a tiny bit of bone meal and some sand. After placing
the bulb, being certain to put the root end down, and the pointed
top up, cover with sand and pack the turf firmly back in place.</p>

<p>A better way is to lift the turf with a spade. Dig, to loosen
up the soil; add a little bone meal; plant bulbs, replace sod.</p>

<p>To place them in an artistic position, throw down a handful
and plant where they fall.</p></div>

<p>“Isn’t it?” cried Eleanor. “I believe

bulbs.”</p>

<p>“What kinds are we going to plant?” asked Mary
Frances, looking at the large package the boys had
brought with them.</p>

<p>They opened it and Bob began to speak: “Young
ladies,” he commenced; then, “Oh, I say, Bill, I can’t
come this ‘professor act.’ You’d better do the lecturing!”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bulbs to Plant in the Fall</span></h3>

<h4><i>Snowdrops</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The earliest Spring garden flower, sometimes coming literally
out of the snow as early as February; but usually blooming in
March. The blossoms are small, white, bell-shaped, not in the
least showy. Only one who has come upon them unexpectedly
blooming in his garden knows the thrill of pleasure which they
bring. As they are small and inexpensive, plant a number of
bulbs about two inches apart, to cover an irregular circle. Once
planted they take care of themselves.</p></div>

<h4><i>Squills</i> (<i>Scilla</i>)</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Near the Snowdrops, plant in the same way, a dozen Siberian
Squills. Beautiful blue flowers, which will bloom perhaps while
some of the Snowdrops are in blossom. Once planted, do not
disturb.</p></div>

<h4><i>Grape Hyacinths</i> (<i>Muscari</i>)</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Little stalks of tiny tight blue bells, or white, somewhat the
shape of tiny fairy-folks’ grapes. Everyone should have a dozen
or so of these pretty early Spring-flowering bulbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p></div>

<h4><i>Narcissus</i> or <i>Daffodils</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Everybody knows a daffodil, for breathes there a human being
with soul so dead as not to feel warmth of heart at the sunshine
glow of its yellow petals?</p>

<p>But not everybody knows the difference between daffodils and
jonquils and narcissus.</p>

<p>The fact is, they are all sold by dealers under the name
Narcissus.</p>

<p>Every Narcissus has a “cup and saucer” form. In some, the
cup, or <i>trumpet</i>, is tall; in some, it is short; in others, it is double:
and according to the shape of the cup, each Narcissus is named.</p>

<p>All dealers agree that the type with the double cup is called
<i>daffodil</i>. It is not generally thought so attractive as the single sorts.</p>

<p>The single sorts are of the following different varieties of
Narcissus:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="narcissuses">
<tr><td align="right" class="set"><i>Narcissus</i></td>
<td align="left">—</td>
<td align="left" class="btlb">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><div class="hang1"><i>Giant Trumpet.</i> Very showy, with large cups and
saucers. Buy “Emperor,” and “Empress.”</div>
<div class="hang1"><i>Medium Trumpet.</i> (“Star” Narcissus.) Not so
large nor attractive, but very graceful. Buy
“Barii Conspicuus.”</div>
<div class="hang1"><i>Poet’s Narcissus.</i> Old-fashioned favorite. Charming
fragrant white flowers, with cups edged with red.
Buy “Poeticus” (Pheasant’s Eye) or “King Edward
VII.” Very easily grown.</div></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>


<p><i>Jonquils</i> are the small-flowering type of Narcissus. They are
easily grown, and many have a charming fragrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Polyanthus Narcissus</i> or Nosegay Daffodils are the little
clustered kind grown indoors.</p>

<p>All these distinctions, and many others, are made by the
dealers, but almost everyone of us thinks of all the yellow Narcissus
as Daffodils. They grow so readily, with almost no care, that
everyone, with only the tiniest garden, should plant at least a
half dozen bulbs of the “Giant Emperor.”</p>

<p>Within a few years after planting, the Spring will bring
dozens of blossoms of—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Daffodown-dilly,</div>
<div class="verse">Come up to town,</div>
<div class="verse">In a green petticoat</div>
<div class="verse">And a gold gown.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<h4><i>Hyacinths</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Single sorts do better than double. As a rule, hyacinths do
not improve from being kept in the ground all Winter; they may be
taken up and stored in a cool cellar over Winter to be planted in
the early Spring; but a better plan is to let the old bulbs gradually
“run out,” and plant a few new bulbs each Fall. These
are sent to dealers every Autumn from Holland, because the
climate of Holland is nearly perfect for bulb growing. Sometimes
hyacinths do quite well for a number of years kept in the ground
out-of-doors.</p>

<p>Their charming fragrance, color and form, make them a most
attractive flower. They come in white, pinks and purples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p></div>

<h4><i>Tulips</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The most gorgeous of all Spring-flowering bulbs.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="tulips">

<td align="left"><div class="hang1"><i>Early Single.</i> Grow about eight inches high; come in
pinks, reds, yellows, white.</div>
<div class="hang1"><i>Early Double.</i> These are not so beautiful as the single
varieties.</div>
<div class="hang1"><i>Cottage Garden</i> (May flowering). A tall variety, growing
about eighteen inches high, blooming much later than
the Early Single.</div>
<div class="hang1"><i>Darwin.</i> The most desirable of all tulips, but not very
early. The tallest grow nearly thirty inches high.
Globe-shaped flowers of most brilliant shades of reds,
purples, pinks and white. If yellow is desired, buy
one of the Cottage Garden, for there are no yellow
Darwins.</div>
<div class="hang1"><i>Parrot.</i> Showy; of variegated shading and irregular
petals. Not so artistic as single sorts, but very odd
and interesting. Buy only a <i>few</i> bulbs.</div></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>While tulips are most effective if planted in groups or masses,
an edging of the stiff blooms of the Early Single is delightful,
especially if a red is alternated with a white. They look almost
like “candles in bloom.”</p></div>

<h4><i>Lilies</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lilies dislike sour soil, so sprinkle some lime over the ground
before digging it deeply. A little powdered charcoal in each hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
helps, too, and it is well to dust each bulb with flowers of sulphur
to protect from worms and mildew.</p>

<p>Lilies love shade, and do best among other perennials because
they will shade their roots, which spread out near the surface of
the ground. By the way, since they spread near the surface, do
not “cultivate” lilies. Do not disturb the bulbs, which will bloom
for years if planted right in the first place. Most lilies bloom in
Mid-summer.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bulbs to Plant in Early Spring</span></h3>

<p>Among these are:</p></div>

<h4><i>Tuberoses</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Plant in May, and again in June and July, in order to have a
continuation of bloom of these powerfully fragrant and beautiful
white flowers.</p></div>

<h4><i>Gladiolus</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These bulbs are planted in May and June at two weeks
intervals, in order to have blooms from July to October. They
like rich soil, and powdered sheep manure, which is sold by the
pound, is a good substitute for rotted stable manure. They like
the sunny places.</p>

<p>The bulbs of both tuberoses and gladiolus should be taken
out of the ground in the Fall after the foliage becomes yellow.
The stems are cut off and the bulbs dried on an airy shelf, or any
place which is neither very warm nor very cold. They are set in the
ground again in the Spring.</p>

<p>Cannas and dahlias grow from fleshy roots and are planted
in the Spring also. They are lifted and dried in the Fall.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Growing Bulbs Indoors</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is very interesting and delightful to grow bulbs indoors,
where the warmth “forces” them into bloom in the cold winter
months. If they are managed in the right way, you may have
blooms from Christmas on. Do not attempt to have over a half
dozen pots the first year.</p>

<p>Bulbs may be grown indoors in pots or in prepared fibre,
which may be bought of a dealer.</p>

<p>If grown in pots, prepare a rich soil of sand and leaf mold.
If impossible to get leaf mold, use a sprinkling of bone meal.
Place some pieces of broken flower pots or pebbles in the bottom
of the pots to drain the water off, or the bulbs will mold.</p>

<p>If grown in prepared fibre, moisten the fibre before putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
in the pot, but do not make it wet enough to wring. Plant bulbs
as in soil, but do not pack in tight. After watering, turn pot on
the side to drain off the water. A piece of charcoal in the bottom
of the pan or pot keeps the fibre sweet.</p>

<p>Hyacinths do well when grown in glass vases. The glass
vases used are made for the purpose, and hold the bulb just above
the water—not touching.</p>

<p>The main point in growing bulbs indoors is to arrange to keep
them growing in a <i>dark, cool</i> place until the roots have formed and
the leaves show about three inches.</p>

<p>This is accomplished in several different ways. Perhaps the
simplest of all is to place the pots on a cool cellar floor and cover
them with ashes, which will assure their being kept in the dark.
Keep them damp by watering the ashes once or twice a week.
(The same idea is better carried out by the use of a <i>cold frame</i>, the
making of which is described in the next chapter.)</p>

<p>Place the pots on ashes in the frame, throwing three or
four inches of ashes over them; or use dried peat moss instead
of ashes. This is sold by dealers in seeds and plants.</p>

<p>Place glass cover on the cold frame when the weather becomes
severe.</p>

<p>About three weeks before you wish them to bloom bring some
of the potted bulbs into the warmth of the house. Do not place
them immediately in a very warm place or in the sunlight. Give
them as much fresh air as possible.</p>

<p>After planting bulbs in prepared fibre, or hyacinths in glasses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
keep them in a dark, airy closet until the roots have formed, which
will be in about six weeks. Then bring them into warmth and
light. The roots of the hyacinth should reach the bottom of the
glasses before bringing them into the light.</p>

<p>Daffodils and single tulips, crocuses, polyanthus narcissus
(often grown in pebbles in water) all are easily forced into bloom
indoors.</p></div>

<p>“But,” added Billy as Bob drew a long breath,
“growing bulbs indoors is a rather tedious experiment,
and better not be attempted by young children,”
as he pulled Mary Frances’ hair ribbon untied.</p>

<p>“Well, neither of you would have known much,
Mr. Superior Knowledge,” laughed Eleanor, “if you
hadn’t studied this all within a week or so.”</p>

<p>“Let’s begin to plant,” was Billy’s answer.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">DURING the Christmas holidays the children
made wonderful plans for their gardens.</p>

<p>“Everything should be started very early,”
said Bob, airing his newly acquired knowledge, “and
the best place to start seeds is in a hotbed.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what we’ll do, Bob,” Billy suggested.
“Let’s come home in March and build one!”</p>

<p>“Won’t that be grand!” cried the girls with enthusiasm.
“We’ll help all we can.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You can’t——” began Billy, then stopped.</p>

</div>
<p>So one sunny day in the early part of March, just
the very day Eleanor discovered some of the snowdrops
blooming, the boys surprised them. About an hour after
they came, the lumber and sashes for the hotbed arrived.</p>

<p>“We bought the frames ready to set up,” Billy said,
“but a fellow could make one quite well. Even a
grocery box, if cut in the right shape and covered with
glass, makes a good substitute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, we made that kind at school for practice,”
added Bob, and to show how well he had learned his
lesson, he started to dig where they had decided to
place the hotbed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Billy referred to his useful note book,
and explained what they were about to do. “The
situation is very important,” he said, “for we learned
at school that a—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hotbed</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">should be sheltered from the north winds; so, if possible, place it
on the south side of a large building.</p>

<p>Let it slant toward the sunny south, where the glass sash will
catch the sun’s rays.</p>

<p>You see, a hotbed is a tiny greenhouse. In both a greenhouse
and a hotbed, artificial heat is supplied.</p>

<p>Greenhouses are heated by steam or hot water pipes: ordinary
hotbeds are heated by fresh manure, which, in the process of
decomposing, gives off a great amount of heat.</p>

<p>Heat, air and sunlight are essential for plants’ growth.</p>

<p>The slanting glass sash catches the sunshine, and holds in
the heat which the manure gives off. The sashes are raised a
little in the warmest part of each day, which gives the plants air.</p>

<p>The frame is generally about eighteen inches high in back and
twelve inches in front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>Dig nearly two feet deep, in a space a foot wider and longer
than the frame.</p>

<p>Get ready a pile of fresh horse manure which has been mixed
with one-third as much bedding straw or litter.</p>

<p>If very dry, sprinkle with water. When, in a day or two, it
begins to steam, turn it well over, and in a day or so more, fill
the dug-out space to within six inches of the top.</p>

<p>Place the frame on this, and bank up the <i>outside</i> with more
manure. Cover the manure with earth.</p>

<p>Fill the inside with earth six or eight inches deep, and water

up to 120 degrees, but in a few days will come down to 90 degrees,
when the bed is ready for planting.</p>

<p>Seeds may be planted direct in the soil, but a more convenient
plan is to fill shallow boxes, called “flats,” with soil, and plant
the seeds in them, placing them in the hotbed. They are easily
lifted if a slat is nailed across the middle, when the young plants
are ready for transplanting into the—</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Frame</span></h3>

<p>The frame and glass sash of a cold frame are just like those of
a hotbed, but the cold frame is placed on the ground without fresh
manure, sometimes without any manure.</p>

<p>Usually, the earth is dug up to the depth of a foot and
mixed with well-rotted manure and the frame placed on <i>top</i> of it.
Soil is also banked up on the outside for protection from cold winds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>An old cooled off hotbed is really a cold frame.</p>

<p>A cold frame is always useful for—</p>

<p>1. “Wintering over” plants a little too tender to leave unprotected.</p>

<p>2. Transplanting seedlings (young plants) from the hotbed,
where they will gradually become accustomed to a cooler atmosphere
before they are placed in the outside ground.</p>

<p>Young lettuce plants may be placed in the cold frame in the
Autumn, and will supply salad nearly all winter.</p>

<p>Parsley and herbs will stay green the winter through if placed
in the cold frame.</p>

<p>Some hardier seeds may be started in the cold frame instead
of the hotbed; such as cucumber or melons.</p>

<p>Always cover the sash with burlap or old carpet on very cold
nights, to prevent young plants from freezing.</p></div>

<p>Before the boys returned to school, the children had
sowed in their new hotbed the seeds of the following
flowers and vegetables:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MARY FRANCES repeated to Eleanor some of
the lessons which Billy had given her on
growing vegetables.</p>

</div>
<p>She had a little book in which she had taken notes.</p>

<p>“Billy told me,” she said, “that when he was
little, he used to wonder why things wouldn’t grow if
they were just ‘stuck down’ in the ground. You
see, he didn’t know that the making of the beds was
the most important matter of all.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve heard people say that anything would
grow if planted by certain people—that they ‘had
luck,’” Eleanor stated.</p>

<p>“If you had watched those very people,” Mary
Frances replied wisely, “you would probably have
seen that they loosened up the soil before they ‘stuck’
the plant down.”</p>

<p>“I imagine that’s true,” agreed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Well,” Mary Frances continued, opening her book,
“as you know, in getting the outdoor beds ready, you—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<ul class="left">
<li>(1) Dig deep to loosen the soil;</li>
<li>(2) Spread over it well-rotted manure;</li>
<li>(3) Dig and turn the soil over again;</li>
<li>(4) Rake the top soil fine and level.</li>
</ul>


<p>It is a good plan to spread leaves and manure over the ground
in the Fall and dig them in in the Spring to make the soil rich
and crumbly, or friable.</p>

<p>Did you ever think how many different parts of plants are
used for food?</p>

<p>We eat the <i>roots</i> of some vegetables; such as beets, carrots,
radishes, turnips.</p>

<p>Of others we use the <i>leaves;</i> such as lettuce, celery, cabbage,
spinach, parsley.</p>

<p>Of others, the seeds; as beans, peas, corn.</p>

<p>Of others, the fruit; as peppers, melons, tomatoes.</p>

<p>In transplanting, always press with your fingers the soil

<h3><span class="smcap">Fertilizers</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As you know, in order to make good and rapid growth, plants
need the right kind of food. Manure is the best fertilizer. In
manure almost every kind of plant food is supplied, but there are
chemical foods which stimulate growth and are easily applied.
If it is impossible to obtain manure, use decayed vegetables and
leaves, and <i>Commercial Fertilizer</i>, which is made up of the mineral
or chemical food needed by plants. Do not use too much, for
it is very heating and may burn the roots of young plants. Never
let the roots come into direct contact with the powder—always
sprinkle some earth over it after throwing a small quantity (about
two tablespoonfuls) in a hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bone meal</i> or Ground Bone is another excellent food. If
sprinkled on the ground and dug in around the roots of roses, it
will give them a good food supply.</p>

<p><i>Nitrate of Soda</i> is a very stimulating food for <i>vegetables</i>. Use
1 tablespoonful in 4 quarts of water in the sprinkler. Do not use
until the plants are at least 3 inches high, and only once in two
weeks. Sprinkle ground near roots—do not sprinkle leaves.</p>

<p><i>Cow Manure</i> and <i>Sheep Manure</i> may be purchased in powdered
form for use in a small garden, and in this form are most easily
managed by little folks.</p>

<p>Powdered Sheep Manure dug in around the roots of roses once
a month assures a wealth of bloom.</p></div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Insecticides</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All plants will be attacked by insects.</p>

<p>One of the best insecticides for children to use, because it is
not poisonous to human beings, is Slug Shot, a patent preparation,
which will kill worms and many other biting insects. It is inexpensive
and need be dusted but lightly on foliage which is
bitten.</p>

<p>Tobacco tea made by throwing boiling water over tobacco
stems, and letting it cool, is used for aphides (Plant lice).</p>

<p><i>Bermuda Buttercup Oxalis</i> blooms all winter in clusters of
golden yellow flowers. The foliage is beautiful,
resembling that of clover.</p>

<p><i>Grand Duchess Oxalis</i>, in pink, is another
charming house plant. It comes in white and
lavender also.</p>

<p>The other types of Oxalis are pretty in
hanging baskets.</p>

<p>The bulbs of Oxalis cost from three to five
cents each. Plant six in a pot, and be certain
to give them good soil, partly leaf loam.
Keep them in a dark, cool place for a short
time. Water them as they dry out. Bring
to the light gradually. They will sometimes
bloom in six weeks. Oxalis, already started,
may be had of a florist.</p>

green decoration for the house in winter.</p></div>

<p>Immerse the pot in a bucket of water, and leave it until it
stops bubbling. This done twice a week is far better than daily
sprinkling. Neither is it good to keep water in a saucer under a
plant; the roots do not like a constant soaking. Wash the leaves
from time to time, and when the weather is warm enough, give
them some fresh air.</p>

<p>Tobacco dust will keep away green lice (aphides); so, also,
will Persian insect powder. Blow either on with little bellows,
or “air guns.”</p>

<p>There is a plant food for house plants which is sold by dealers.
One teaspoonful dug into the earth once in two weeks is very beneficial

<p>It is difficult to describe the beauty of Mary
Frances’ garden. Peeping over the green velvet of
the lawn is a border of low-growing white flowers
which look like ribbons of snow. They are sweet
alyssum—“Little Gem.”</p>

<p>Just back of them come pink Baby Rambler roses;
next, a large mass of charming blue-lavender eupatorium;
and “locking arms” with the eupatorium, on
the other side, is a rudbeckia, a bush bearing little
“brown-eyed” flowers.</p>

<p>Between the pink of the Baby Rambler and the
blue of the eupatorium is a bush of feverfew; and
between the blue of the eupatorium and the yellow of
the rudbeckia is the white of achillea.</p>

<p>Mary Frances says that she thinks that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
flowers form the most perfect color-picture in her
garden.</p>

<p>On the other side of the garden are perennial sunflowers
which are so much more desirable than golden
glow, and beneath them are brilliant nasturtiums.</p>

<p>One must remember that the various shades of
one color always combine well together.</p>

<p>For instance, in the Spring, Mary Frances has
pink tulips blooming just beneath a bush of flowering
almond; and daffodils beneath golden bell or forsythia.</p>

<p>The flowering almond and forsythia shrubs that
Mary Frances has, she grew from little sprigs which a
neighbor gave her. She simply put them down into
the ground and kept them well watered!</p>

<p>All the flowers mentioned except nasturtiums are
hardy perennials, and have never had but the slightest
care since planting two years ago, except thinning
out where they became too thick.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Materials required:</p>

<p>Pink, green, yellow tissue paper; white tracing paper; very
<i>fine</i> wire; heavy wire for stem; yellow beads; small piece beeswax;
pair small pincers; scissors; glue.</p>

<p>1. To make the <i>corolla</i>,—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Lay a piece of pink tissue paper over the pattern of the
<i>corolla</i> shown in the picture on the next page.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Cut out; and curl the tips of the petals, by drawing them
through between the thumb and blade of the scissors, just as
your mother does ostrich feathers.</p>

<p>2. Trace, through a piece of tracing paper, the <i>calyx</i>, and
<i>foliage</i>, as shown in the picture. Cut out, and use for patterns
in cutting green tissue paper calyx and leaves.</p>

<p>3. To make the <i>stamens</i>,—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Cut three pieces of fine wire, two and a half inches long,
for the <i>filaments</i>. (See picture of stamens.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a><br /><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>b</i>) Fasten a small yellow bead <i>anther</i> on each end of the
wire <i>filaments</i>, by bending the end of the wire over the bead
with pincers. Fold the filament wires in half.</p>

<p>4. To make the <i>pistil</i> and <i>stem</i>,—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Cut a piece of heavy wire six inches long—to form the
<i>stem</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) On one end, fasten a large yellow bead to form the <i>stigma</i>.
Cut a piece of fine wire eight inches long. One inch below the
<i>stigma</i> bead, hold the folded <i>filament</i> wires in a little bundle
around the stem wire, and wind with the fine eight inch wire—to
form the <i>ovary</i>. The heavy wire between the <i>stigma</i> and the
<i>ovary</i> represents the <i>style</i>.</p>

<p>5. Cut a piece of beeswax a little less than a half-inch square.
Mould it with the fingers under hot water until you have a soft
ball.</p>

<p>6. Slip the pink <i>corolla</i> up the wire stem until over the
wound wire. Spread the <i>stamens</i> out to prevent the corolla
from slipping off.</p>

<p>7. Fit the beeswax over the wound wire to form the <i>calyx</i>
cup; and pack a tiny bit of yellow tissue paper into the opening
of the corolla <i>under the stamens</i>.</p>

<p>8. Wind the <i>calyx cup</i> with the green tissue paper calyx
which you cut by the pattern, and fasten the end with a tip of
glue.</p>

her unawares.</p>

“He taught two friends and me so well, that next year
we are each to have our own garden plot, and ‘race’

<p>Perhaps he did know—for one year from that day,

<p><b>THE MARY FRANCES GARDEN BOOK, or Adventures Among the Garden People.</b> The spirit
of comradeship and of loving understanding of little men and women thoroughly permeates this unique
garden book. The enchantment of the story of Mary Frances’ gardens successfully carries the play-lesson
idea, as the most potent method of creating a love for work and learning, into a realm undreamed
of before. The little reader’s delight is heightened by cut-out gardens which are inserted
in the book. These cut-out gardens are beautifully colored to show the natural color of the flowers,
insects, etc. They include a playhouse, April and May garden, June and July garden, August and
September garden, vegetable garden, etc., and will not only familiarize the child with the plants
and their seasons of bloom, but also inspire a love for practical outdoor gardening. The world was
begun in a garden, and the story of reproduction is given in a most reserved and skilful manner as
the great plan for the perpetuation of life. Size 7¼ x 9½ inches. Illustrations on every page, with
colored cut-out gardens. Cloth, with colored inlay on front.</p>

<p><b>THE MARY FRANCES HOUSEKEEPER, or Adventures Among the Doll People.</b> A glimpse
into this book is enough to make a girl’s heart leap. Here she finds not only the story of the Paper
Doll Family of Sandpile Village, and how they acquired a home, but also the paper dolls themselves—thirty-six
large sheets of dolls and of the new, patented kind of cut-out furniture. The practical
explanation of household duties and management are woven in so skilfully that as the story tells
how Mary Frances learned to dust, to sweep, or make beds, the little reader takes it all in eagerly
as part of the story. 250 pages. 7¼ x 9½ inches. Illustrations on every page. Cloth, with
colored inlay on front.</p>

<p><b>THE MARY FRANCES SEWING BOOK, or Adventures Among the Thimble People.</b> It tells,
in as quaint and delightful a story as ever appealed to a child’s imagination, how the fairy “Thimble
People” teach Mary Frances to sew. It teaches <i>the reader</i> how to sew—how to make every variety
of garment—how to make the various stitches—how to use patterns—how to fold and cut the
material—how to piece it together. The book includes a complete set of patterns for doll clothes—undergarments—street
clothes—coats—hats—even a wedding dress. 300 colored illustrations.

book so happily combines fact and fancy that any girl who reads it will all unconsciously absorb
the principles of cookery while devouring the most fascinating sort of story. It throws a glamor
around the processes of baking and boiling and leads girls into pleasant habits of usefulness and
industry. The book gives recipes in the simplest, plainest words. It describes every operation
clearly—just what Mary Frances did, and how she learned to avoid mistakes. The book stimulates
the imagination and creates a desire to follow Mary Frances’ example. Cloth, 170 pages.

<p><b>FAIRY TALES OF ALL NATIONS—By Logan
Marshall.</b> The most beautiful book of fairy tales
ever published. Thirty superb colored plates are
the most prominent feature of this new copyrighted
book. These plates are absolutely new and portray
the times and customs of the subject they illustrate.
The subjects were posed in costumes of the nation and time in which each
story is set, and are unrivaled in rich color, lively drawing and dramatic
interest. The text is original and interesting in that the famous fairy
tales are taken from the folk-lore and literature of a dozen principal
countries, thus giving the book its name. Many old favorites and
numerous interesting stories from far-away lands, which most children
have never heard, are brought together in this charming book. 8vo.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
